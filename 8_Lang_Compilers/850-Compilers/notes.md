[book] [TeachYourselfCS2] THE DRAGON BOOK: Compilers: Principles, Techniques & Tools,
  Alex Aiken's Lagunitas course

    Use the course to get through Compilers: Principles, Techniques & Tools instead of doing the book outright
[book] [TeachYourselfCS2alt(OLD)] As a potential alternative to the Dragon Book we suggest Language Implementation Patterns by Terence Parr. It is written more directly for the practicing software engineer who intends to work on small language projects like DSLs, which may make it more practical for your purposes. Of course, it sacrifices some valuable theory to do so.
  For project work, we suggest writing a compiler either for a simple teaching language like COOL, or for a subset of a language that interests you. Those who find such a project daunting could start with Make a Lisp, which steps you through the project.

Making Compilers
  Consider making a transpiler (Blub) that swaps syntax back-and-forth
