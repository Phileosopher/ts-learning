This is the sausage-making for [my TechSplained website](https://techsplained.xyz).

For copyright reasons, I've omitted videos and ebooks from this upload.

In case you're wondering, TechSplained is using WordPress. Easy-peasy to setup, but back-end would require something fiercely complicated to make open to the public, so all you can really see is the back-end.

Also, I'm building out my [toolbox](https://github.com/philosaccounting/toolbox) at the same time, so feel free to follow *that* for something legitimately useful!

If you want to stay abreast of updates as they happen, I highly recommend you either use [Follow That Page](https://www.followthatpage.com/) on TechSplained or follow my updates directly at [my /now page](https://stucky.tech/now).
