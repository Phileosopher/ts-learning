how to saturate bandwidth
  I want to contribute to something:
  Run a dozen or so ArchiveTeam Warrior VMs. They receive jobs from the central ArchiveTeam server to download important content for preservation. Almost nonstop sending / receiving traffic.
  Get a torrent client and find as many Linux ISOs as you can - then seed them endlessly. This will have a huge spike in the beginning, then taper off, but provide huge benefit to the community.
  Run a Tor Relay Node or two. Your network becomes another hop in the Tor Network, keeping others anonymous. Virtually no risk as all traffic is encrypted and zero-knowledge.
  (Potentially legally risky)
  Operate a Tor Exit Node. Your network becomes a portal through which unresolvable queries exit onto the surface web - this will get your account with the service provider suspended FAST.
  or...
  I don't care about contributing, just saturate my connection NOW:
  Fire up JDownloader or another download manager and queue up some of the Internet Archive's collections. Direct download, straight to your PC. The same goes for Project Gutenberg, there are a couple of downloads for that floating around.
  Write a script that checks your torrent client for completion, then deletes the files and forces a recheck. You'll be in an endless loop of redownloading the same files.
  If you want to make actual use of the traffic, I recommend grabbing archives from every online service you own - I know my Google Takeout archives easily reach into the terabytes.
  In general, just keep your torrent client full and your download manager queue lengthy. If you're on Windows, go to Settings > Update & Security > Delivery Optimization > Advanced Options and crank the upload settings to the absolute max. Your computer then essentially pulls double-duty as a WSUS server for other Windows machines on the Internet.
