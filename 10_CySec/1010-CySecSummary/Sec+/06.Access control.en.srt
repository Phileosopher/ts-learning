1
00:00:01.03 --> 00:00:02.06
- I've got a laptop right here,

2
00:00:02.06 --> 00:00:04.02
and it's got some resources on it

3
00:00:04.02 --> 00:00:06.02
that I want people to have access to.

4
00:00:06.02 --> 00:00:08.05
I might have some Word
documents in a folder,

5
00:00:08.05 --> 00:00:10.04
some videos, whatever it might be.

6
00:00:10.04 --> 00:00:11.09
And because he's on a network,

7
00:00:11.09 --> 00:00:13.05
I want people from all over the network

8
00:00:13.05 --> 00:00:15.00
to be able to get to my laptop.

9
00:00:15.00 --> 00:00:17.04
Easy enough, but when
we start talking about

10
00:00:17.04 --> 00:00:20.01
how we let people have access to stuff,

11
00:00:20.01 --> 00:00:22.01
primarily within the networking world,

12
00:00:22.01 --> 00:00:25.07
we run into authentication
and authorization.

13
00:00:25.07 --> 00:00:29.00
Authentication basically
means what does it take

14
00:00:29.00 --> 00:00:32.04
for you to get into the network,
the system, the computer,

15
00:00:32.04 --> 00:00:34.03
the resource, whatever it might be?

16
00:00:34.03 --> 00:00:35.07
And when we're talking about this,

17
00:00:35.07 --> 00:00:38.03
we're talking about things
like user names and passwords.

18
00:00:38.03 --> 00:00:40.00
We're talking about certificates.

19
00:00:40.00 --> 00:00:42.00
We're talking about RSA tokens.

20
00:00:42.00 --> 00:00:44.04
We're talking about smart
cards, retinal scanners,

21
00:00:44.04 --> 00:00:47.04
whatever it might be, to allow the world

22
00:00:47.04 --> 00:00:50.06
for it to know that you are
who you're supposed to be.

23
00:00:50.06 --> 00:00:52.06
Now once we're in there, though,

24
00:00:52.06 --> 00:00:55.00
so once we're authenticated,
now it's, well,

25
00:00:55.00 --> 00:00:56.05
what can Mike do in there?

26
00:00:56.05 --> 00:00:59.02
And that is where
authorization comes into play.

27
00:00:59.02 --> 00:01:00.05
So make sure you understand the difference

28
00:01:00.05 --> 00:01:03.06
between authentication
versus authorization.

29
00:01:03.06 --> 00:01:05.05
Now the cornerstone to
pretty much everything

30
00:01:05.05 --> 00:01:07.09
that takes place in this
process is something

31
00:01:07.09 --> 00:01:11.01
that we know generically
as an access control list.

32
00:01:11.01 --> 00:01:13.05
Access control lists exist everywhere.

33
00:01:13.05 --> 00:01:16.01
On my computer I have
an access control list

34
00:01:16.01 --> 00:01:17.09
that's pretty much user
names and passwords

35
00:01:17.09 --> 00:01:19.08
and what people can do on folders.

36
00:01:19.08 --> 00:01:23.01
On my wireless network I
have an access control list

37
00:01:23.01 --> 00:01:26.06
that determines the password,
channels, things like that.

38
00:01:26.06 --> 00:01:30.02
On my internet connectivity
I've got an access control list

39
00:01:30.02 --> 00:01:32.07
that blocks port numbers
and things like that.

40
00:01:32.07 --> 00:01:36.05
So access control, this
is a very generic term.

41
00:01:36.05 --> 00:01:38.05
And we have to think very
generically about this.

42
00:01:38.05 --> 00:01:40.09
So it could be all kinds
of different things,

43
00:01:40.09 --> 00:01:43.03
but understand that there's
almost always going to be

44
00:01:43.03 --> 00:01:45.01
some type of access control list

45
00:01:45.01 --> 00:01:48.01
when it comes to authentication
and authorization.

46
00:01:48.01 --> 00:01:50.07
Now in particular, authorization
is kind of interesting,

47
00:01:50.07 --> 00:01:52.07
because over the years they've come up

48
00:01:52.07 --> 00:01:54.01
with a number of ways to do this.

49
00:01:54.01 --> 00:01:56.02
So what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna use folders

50
00:01:56.02 --> 00:01:57.08
as my analogy here.

51
00:01:57.08 --> 00:02:00.04
And there are three
types of access control

52
00:02:00.04 --> 00:02:02.09
that you need to be aware
of for the Network+.

53
00:02:02.09 --> 00:02:06.06
The first one is known as
mandatory access control.

54
00:02:06.06 --> 00:02:08.05
In a mandatory access control world,

55
00:02:08.05 --> 00:02:11.03
you would put labels, for
example, here's Top Secret,

56
00:02:11.03 --> 00:02:13.09
on an actual resource itself

57
00:02:13.09 --> 00:02:16.04
and, based on the label,
defined what you could

58
00:02:16.04 --> 00:02:18.09
or could not do on that
particular resource.

59
00:02:18.09 --> 00:02:21.04
So it was pretty much either
you could access the resource

60
00:02:21.04 --> 00:02:22.07
or not access it.

61
00:02:22.07 --> 00:02:24.08
So Top Secret, as you can tell, this came

62
00:02:24.08 --> 00:02:26.00
from the US military,

63
00:02:26.00 --> 00:02:27.09
so it's kind of an
old-fashioned way to do it.

64
00:02:27.09 --> 00:02:30.02
Now there's nothing wrong
with mandatory access control

65
00:02:30.02 --> 00:02:31.08
other than it was a little bit limiting.

66
00:02:31.08 --> 00:02:35.02
So over the years, they
came up with another type

67
00:02:35.02 --> 00:02:37.08
called discretionary access control.

68
00:02:37.08 --> 00:02:39.08
With a discretionary access control,

69
00:02:39.08 --> 00:02:41.05
you could actually define the resource

70
00:02:41.05 --> 00:02:42.07
in lots of different ways.

71
00:02:42.07 --> 00:02:47.00
For example, you can put the
term Owner onto a user account.

72
00:02:47.00 --> 00:02:49.05
So Mike is the owner of this resource.

73
00:02:49.05 --> 00:02:51.07
Other people can be
readers of the resource.

74
00:02:51.07 --> 00:02:53.05
Other people can write to the resource,

75
00:02:53.05 --> 00:02:54.09
whatever it might be.

76
00:02:54.09 --> 00:02:57.04
But discretionary gives a
little bit more flexibility

77
00:02:57.04 --> 00:03:00.04
with the old-school
mandatory access control.

78
00:03:00.04 --> 00:03:03.01
Now this was good, but what
we really do tend to use today

79
00:03:03.01 --> 00:03:07.04
more than anything else is
role-based access control.

80
00:03:07.04 --> 00:03:09.05
So with a role-based access control,

81
00:03:09.05 --> 00:03:11.08
we can finally use something
called groups, yay!

82
00:03:11.08 --> 00:03:14.04
So with groups, what we could do is

83
00:03:14.04 --> 00:03:17.08
we can then create users,
put the users into a group.

84
00:03:17.08 --> 00:03:18.08
Now pay attention here.

85
00:03:18.08 --> 00:03:22.08
And what we can do is we can
assign rights and permissions

86
00:03:22.08 --> 00:03:26.05
to a group to define what it
can do with a shared resource.

87
00:03:26.05 --> 00:03:30.02
So if you take a look at, for
example, Microsoft Windows

88
00:03:30.02 --> 00:03:33.01
and what they call their best
practices, they have a mantra.

89
00:03:33.01 --> 00:03:35.03
If you ever go for
Microsoft certification,

90
00:03:35.03 --> 00:03:36.09
and we all have this memorized,

91
00:03:36.09 --> 00:03:39.04
and it's that users go into groups

92
00:03:39.04 --> 00:03:41.09
who then get rights and
permissions to folders.

93
00:03:41.09 --> 00:03:43.05
So with role-based access control

94
00:03:43.05 --> 00:03:46.07
we can use groups to provide
all kinds of flexibility

95
00:03:46.07 --> 00:03:48.03
that we don't see with mandatory

96
00:03:48.03 --> 00:03:50.08
or discretionary access controls.

97
00:03:50.08 --> 00:03:53.07
So for the Network+ make
sure you can memorize

98
00:03:53.07 --> 00:03:57.07
mandatory access control,
discretionary access control,

99
00:03:57.07 --> 00:03:59.09
and role-based access control.
