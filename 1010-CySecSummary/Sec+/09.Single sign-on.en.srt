1
00:00:00.06 --> 00:00:03.09
- We live in a world
where we as individuals

2
00:00:03.09 --> 00:00:06.08
want to access lots and lots of computers.

3
00:00:06.08 --> 00:00:07.09
I mean, just think about this,

4
00:00:07.09 --> 00:00:09.04
in your normal browsing life,

5
00:00:09.04 --> 00:00:11.05
you go to all kinds of different websites.

6
00:00:11.05 --> 00:00:14.02
Those are actual computers
and you have to access them.

7
00:00:14.02 --> 00:00:16.07
Now web might be a little
bit of a tricky one

8
00:00:16.07 --> 00:00:18.09
because web is a public kind of tool

9
00:00:18.09 --> 00:00:22.02
but we can trivially add
usernames and passwords

10
00:00:22.02 --> 00:00:23.08
to any website that wanted to.

11
00:00:23.08 --> 00:00:26.01
People don't do it very often but you can.

12
00:00:26.01 --> 00:00:27.08
Let's take a better example.

13
00:00:27.08 --> 00:00:29.08
Let's talk about a local area network.

14
00:00:29.08 --> 00:00:32.04
So here at Total Seminars,
we've got lots and lots

15
00:00:32.04 --> 00:00:34.03
of computers and people are sharing stuff

16
00:00:34.03 --> 00:00:38.00
and we got servers and printers
and all kinds of things

17
00:00:38.00 --> 00:00:40.08
that I as an individual
want to be able to access.

18
00:00:40.08 --> 00:00:44.07
In a typical Windows workgroup,

19
00:00:44.07 --> 00:00:47.06
what we do is we have
well, here's an example.

20
00:00:47.06 --> 00:00:49.06
We've got three or four computers,

21
00:00:49.06 --> 00:00:51.08
we got a printer, and
whatever it might be.

22
00:00:51.08 --> 00:00:55.04
Now each one of these hosts have their own

23
00:00:55.04 --> 00:00:58.02
username and password
list and it works great.

24
00:00:58.02 --> 00:01:01.04
The challenge is that if I
wanna access one computer,

25
00:01:01.04 --> 00:01:03.00
I have to have a username and password

26
00:01:03.00 --> 00:01:05.06
on that computer that I can log in with.

27
00:01:05.06 --> 00:01:07.04
If I wanna access another computer,

28
00:01:07.04 --> 00:01:10.03
it may have a different
username and password.

29
00:01:10.03 --> 00:01:13.09
So the Windows workgroups
which have been around now

30
00:01:13.09 --> 00:01:17.07
for over 30 years work very, very well.

31
00:01:17.07 --> 00:01:20.06
And we can go ahead and log
into these individual computers

32
00:01:20.06 --> 00:01:22.04
but once in a while, you
wanna start logging into

33
00:01:22.04 --> 00:01:24.03
a lot of computers at once.

34
00:01:24.03 --> 00:01:25.07
And you wanna go to this
computer and that computer

35
00:01:25.07 --> 00:01:26.09
and after a while you start going

36
00:01:26.09 --> 00:01:28.09
I can't remember all these passwords.

37
00:01:28.09 --> 00:01:30.05
So well you can do one thing.

38
00:01:30.05 --> 00:01:31.06
You could cheat.

39
00:01:31.06 --> 00:01:34.02
So if we take a look at
this example one more time,

40
00:01:34.02 --> 00:01:35.03
what I could do is I could put

41
00:01:35.03 --> 00:01:37.00
the same username and password

42
00:01:37.00 --> 00:01:39.02
on every single one of these computers

43
00:01:39.02 --> 00:01:40.08
on my local area network.

44
00:01:40.08 --> 00:01:43.00
And that way, I don't
have to log in every time

45
00:01:43.00 --> 00:01:44.08
because once I log into my computer

46
00:01:44.08 --> 00:01:48.05
it will in essence carry that
authentication information

47
00:01:48.05 --> 00:01:51.01
to each one of these other computers

48
00:01:51.01 --> 00:01:54.01
and it'll always think that
I have a user called Timmy

49
00:01:54.01 --> 00:01:56.06
with a password of 1234.

50
00:01:56.06 --> 00:01:58.07
That is not a good idea.

51
00:01:58.07 --> 00:02:00.09
And is a very dangerous security issue

52
00:02:00.09 --> 00:02:02.05
and it is a big problem.

53
00:02:02.05 --> 00:02:04.00
So what can we do instead?

54
00:02:04.00 --> 00:02:07.04
Well, what we can do is single sign-on.

55
00:02:07.04 --> 00:02:11.06
The idea behind single
sign-on is that I log in once

56
00:02:11.06 --> 00:02:14.06
to something and then
everything else I need to get to

57
00:02:14.06 --> 00:02:16.07
I'm automatically logged into.

58
00:02:16.07 --> 00:02:19.01
Now single sign-on is a great idea

59
00:02:19.01 --> 00:02:20.03
but it works differently depending

60
00:02:20.03 --> 00:02:21.02
on how you're talking about it

61
00:02:21.02 --> 00:02:23.01
so let's start with the most classic

62
00:02:23.01 --> 00:02:26.03
and that is single sign-on
on a local area of network.

63
00:02:26.03 --> 00:02:27.08
To do that, we're gonna have

64
00:02:27.08 --> 00:02:29.08
to use Windows Active Directory.

65
00:02:29.08 --> 00:02:31.04
Now Windows Active
Directory has been around

66
00:02:31.04 --> 00:02:33.09
forever and it is the gold standard

67
00:02:33.09 --> 00:02:35.08
when it comes to single sign-on tools

68
00:02:35.08 --> 00:02:37.05
for local area networks.

69
00:02:37.05 --> 00:02:39.02
It actually works more
than local area networks

70
00:02:39.02 --> 00:02:41.00
but we'll keep it simple for the moment.

71
00:02:41.00 --> 00:02:43.09
So with Active Directory,
what I have to first do

72
00:02:43.09 --> 00:02:46.06
is go purchase a copy of Windows Server

73
00:02:46.06 --> 00:02:48.00
and I install that into my network

74
00:02:48.00 --> 00:02:49.09
and it will look something like this.

75
00:02:49.09 --> 00:02:53.00
So here's my Windows Server
with all these other computers.

76
00:02:53.00 --> 00:02:56.06
Now once I establish a domain

77
00:02:56.06 --> 00:02:58.05
as we call it in the Windows world,

78
00:02:58.05 --> 00:03:03.00
we then have all of these other
computers join this domain.

79
00:03:03.00 --> 00:03:07.00
Now we do this by having a administrator

80
00:03:07.00 --> 00:03:09.09
actually go to each computer
and go through a process

81
00:03:09.09 --> 00:03:11.03
of having them join the domain.

82
00:03:11.03 --> 00:03:14.00
So somebody in a high trust position

83
00:03:14.00 --> 00:03:16.09
has to actually go through and connect

84
00:03:16.09 --> 00:03:19.00
each one of these individual computers

85
00:03:19.00 --> 00:03:20.07
to the domain one at a time.

86
00:03:20.07 --> 00:03:23.09
Now once that's done, we
in essence have created

87
00:03:23.09 --> 00:03:28.08
a trust situation because
I as an administrator

88
00:03:28.08 --> 00:03:32.02
have went to each computer
and said, join this domain.

89
00:03:32.02 --> 00:03:35.00
We have what are known
as federated systems.

90
00:03:35.00 --> 00:03:37.09
When you hear the word
federated, think trust.

91
00:03:37.09 --> 00:03:40.08
So there is an implicit trust
that has been developed there

92
00:03:40.08 --> 00:03:43.04
simply because Microsoft has a proprietary

93
00:03:43.04 --> 00:03:45.05
authentication mechanism based on Kerberos

94
00:03:45.05 --> 00:03:49.05
but the bottom line is is
that we now have trust.

95
00:03:49.05 --> 00:03:53.05
Now if you're gonna be
doing single sign-on

96
00:03:53.05 --> 00:03:55.07
in a local area network, odds are good

97
00:03:55.07 --> 00:03:57.04
you're gonna be using Active Directory.

98
00:03:57.04 --> 00:03:59.08
Even if you have Apple systems,

99
00:03:59.08 --> 00:04:01.08
even if you have Linux systems.

100
00:04:01.08 --> 00:04:04.04
Those can use Windows file and sharing,

101
00:04:04.04 --> 00:04:06.05
or if it's Linux, we can use Samba

102
00:04:06.05 --> 00:04:08.05
and all of these can be configured

103
00:04:08.05 --> 00:04:11.00
to join a local domain
which is actually cool.

104
00:04:11.00 --> 00:04:13.04
I can't tell you how many big systems

105
00:04:13.04 --> 00:04:16.01
you have out there where research areas

106
00:04:16.01 --> 00:04:18.05
really have got 1,500 Linux boxes

107
00:04:18.05 --> 00:04:22.04
and they still have a Windows
Active Directory on there

108
00:04:22.04 --> 00:04:25.02
simply because it's easier
for the maintenance standpoint

109
00:04:25.02 --> 00:04:27.01
to be able to do single sign-on.

110
00:04:27.01 --> 00:04:28.09
So when you're talking about LANs,

111
00:04:28.09 --> 00:04:31.06
you really are talking
about Active Directory

112
00:04:31.06 --> 00:04:33.09
as the single sign-on tool.

113
00:04:33.09 --> 00:04:37.05
Now, there is another
type of single sign-on

114
00:04:37.05 --> 00:04:40.05
and this is completely
different and is based on

115
00:04:40.05 --> 00:04:46.05
something called SAML.

116
00:04:46.05 --> 00:04:48.01
Let me give you a scenario.

117
00:04:48.01 --> 00:04:49.09
Let's say I'm running,
well I live in Texas

118
00:04:49.09 --> 00:04:51.07
so we're running an oil pipeline.

119
00:04:51.07 --> 00:04:54.04
And on this oil pipeline,
we've got lots of pumps

120
00:04:54.04 --> 00:04:57.02
and thermometers and cameras
and all kinds of stuff,

121
00:04:57.02 --> 00:05:00.07
hundreds of little devices
and we've developed web apps

122
00:05:00.07 --> 00:05:03.04
for these devices so
that I can turn pumps on,

123
00:05:03.04 --> 00:05:05.04
turn pumps off, whatever it might be.

124
00:05:05.04 --> 00:05:07.03
Now just because these are web apps,

125
00:05:07.03 --> 00:05:08.04
don't go thinking they're public,

126
00:05:08.04 --> 00:05:10.08
they're well-protected usernames,

127
00:05:10.08 --> 00:05:12.05
passwords, all kinds of stuff.

128
00:05:12.05 --> 00:05:15.06
It's not easy, hopefully
it's basically impossible

129
00:05:15.06 --> 00:05:18.04
for the public to get
to but I as the operator

130
00:05:18.04 --> 00:05:20.05
of all these pumps and everything,

131
00:05:20.05 --> 00:05:22.02
I need to be able to get to these.

132
00:05:22.02 --> 00:05:23.07
But not only do I need to get to them,

133
00:05:23.07 --> 00:05:25.04
I need to get to them securely

134
00:05:25.04 --> 00:05:28.02
and I need to get to them any time I want.

135
00:05:28.02 --> 00:05:29.05
So if I've got a couple of hundred

136
00:05:29.05 --> 00:05:32.00
different web app devices,

137
00:05:32.00 --> 00:05:35.02
I would like to sign on one
time and be done with it.

138
00:05:35.02 --> 00:05:38.04
And that's where SAML
really comes into play.

139
00:05:38.04 --> 00:05:42.03
SAML is designed really for web apps

140
00:05:42.03 --> 00:05:43.06
more than anything else.

141
00:05:43.06 --> 00:05:46.03
And it allows us as a single person

142
00:05:46.03 --> 00:05:48.04
at a single place to log into

143
00:05:48.04 --> 00:05:49.09
a whole bunch of different devices.

144
00:05:49.09 --> 00:05:53.04
So let me show you a
little bit how SAML works.

145
00:05:53.04 --> 00:05:56.05
So here's my oil pipeline
and we'll just put

146
00:05:56.05 --> 00:05:58.06
some devices here along the pipeline.

147
00:05:58.06 --> 00:06:00.09
All of these devices are accessible

148
00:06:00.09 --> 00:06:03.03
through my VPN to be able to get to them

149
00:06:03.03 --> 00:06:05.00
to do whatever I wanna do.

150
00:06:05.00 --> 00:06:07.09
Now the trick here is is I
don't wanna keep logging into

151
00:06:07.09 --> 00:06:10.06
this pump and that pump then that camera.

152
00:06:10.06 --> 00:06:12.06
And that's how SAML works.

153
00:06:12.06 --> 00:06:15.09
SAML starts off with having what we call

154
00:06:15.09 --> 00:06:19.02
an identity provider so that's
gonna be a system somewhere

155
00:06:19.02 --> 00:06:22.09
that's connected out here
that everybody can talk to.

156
00:06:22.09 --> 00:06:25.05
And what I will do is I will sign on

157
00:06:25.05 --> 00:06:27.03
to the identity provider

158
00:06:27.03 --> 00:06:30.04
and then all of these individual web apps

159
00:06:30.04 --> 00:06:32.06
are gonna be called service providers.

160
00:06:32.06 --> 00:06:34.07
So I can jump between any one of these

161
00:06:34.07 --> 00:06:38.03
because the identity provider provides me

162
00:06:38.03 --> 00:06:40.08
with a token that allows me to log

163
00:06:40.08 --> 00:06:44.04
into any one of these different devices.

164
00:06:44.04 --> 00:06:47.08
Now showing you SAML at
work is a little bit tricky

165
00:06:47.08 --> 00:06:50.04
because the only time you're gonna see

166
00:06:50.04 --> 00:06:52.02
SAML really working for a living

167
00:06:52.02 --> 00:06:55.00
is when you have people who have web apps

168
00:06:55.00 --> 00:06:57.01
that they want to really, really control

169
00:06:57.01 --> 00:06:58.04
and they're gonna go ahead

170
00:06:58.04 --> 00:06:59.08
and write a lot of code and you know what?

171
00:06:59.08 --> 00:07:01.06
They don't tend to like people like me

172
00:07:01.06 --> 00:07:03.08
going in and actually working on this.

173
00:07:03.08 --> 00:07:06.04
But what I've got instead
is I've got this wonderful

174
00:07:06.04 --> 00:07:08.02
little company called SSOCircle.

175
00:07:08.02 --> 00:07:12.02
SSOCircle sells single sign-on tool sets

176
00:07:12.02 --> 00:07:14.00
and so they have this nice little demo.

177
00:07:14.00 --> 00:07:16.01
So let me show you how this guy works.

178
00:07:16.01 --> 00:07:18.01
So first of all thank you SSOCircle

179
00:07:18.01 --> 00:07:19.08
for letting me play on your site.

180
00:07:19.08 --> 00:07:21.02
So what I'm gonna do is I've actually

181
00:07:21.02 --> 00:07:23.00
created an account already.

182
00:07:23.00 --> 00:07:28.00
And what I'm gonna do is just
log in and here's my log in.

183
00:07:28.00 --> 00:07:29.08
Now there's a lot of
extra information here.

184
00:07:29.08 --> 00:07:31.02
Keep in mind what they're doing

185
00:07:31.02 --> 00:07:33.06
is they're trying to sell packages

186
00:07:33.06 --> 00:07:36.02
for people who actually
write SAML language.

187
00:07:36.02 --> 00:07:39.01
But what I wanna show you
that's actually kinda cool here

188
00:07:39.01 --> 00:07:41.04
is that I've gone ahead and logged in

189
00:07:41.04 --> 00:07:45.06
to the identity provider
that's provided by SSOCircle.

190
00:07:45.06 --> 00:07:47.05
Now what they do that's
really, really nice

191
00:07:47.05 --> 00:07:50.01
is they provide, let me go,

192
00:07:50.01 --> 00:07:52.05
they provide all of
these service providers.

193
00:07:52.05 --> 00:07:54.07
Now these service providers,
they're just samples,

194
00:07:54.07 --> 00:07:57.09
they're examples of how
logging in with SSOCircle

195
00:07:57.09 --> 00:08:00.00
allows you to log into
other disparate websites.

196
00:08:00.00 --> 00:08:03.03
So I'm gonna pick one here,
here's salesforce.com.

197
00:08:03.03 --> 00:08:07.09
Salesforce.com is a
really, really popular site

198
00:08:07.09 --> 00:08:09.06
for use by sales people and stuff,

199
00:08:09.06 --> 00:08:12.02
customer relationship management tools.

200
00:08:12.02 --> 00:08:15.01
So what we're gonna do here is
if I got this working right,

201
00:08:15.01 --> 00:08:17.08
is now that I've logged into SSOCircle,

202
00:08:17.08 --> 00:08:21.04
it's just gonna pop me
over to one little place

203
00:08:21.04 --> 00:08:24.05
within Salesforce like a
little discussion page.

204
00:08:24.05 --> 00:08:28.07
So let's see how this guy works.

205
00:08:28.07 --> 00:08:30.01
Now what you're seeing here is

206
00:08:30.01 --> 00:08:34.06
because SSOCircle wants
to sell us this product,

207
00:08:34.06 --> 00:08:35.09
what is doing is it's having you

208
00:08:35.09 --> 00:08:37.06
do a little I'm not a robot.

209
00:08:37.06 --> 00:08:39.08
Normally with SAML we would skip this

210
00:08:39.08 --> 00:08:43.03
but we'll go ahead and
just click right on here

211
00:08:43.03 --> 00:08:45.04
and if I've done it right, ta-dah!

212
00:08:45.04 --> 00:08:49.00
I am now auto magically on
a little discussion page

213
00:08:49.00 --> 00:08:50.03
within Salesforce.

214
00:08:50.03 --> 00:08:51.06
Notice that I didn't have to type in

215
00:08:51.06 --> 00:08:53.00
a username or a password.

216
00:08:53.00 --> 00:08:54.03
In fact, if I paid a little money,

217
00:08:54.03 --> 00:08:56.09
I wouldn't even have to do
that I'm not a robot thing.

218
00:08:56.09 --> 00:08:59.01
And that's the power of SAML.

219
00:08:59.01 --> 00:09:00.08
In fact, take a look over here.

220
00:09:00.08 --> 00:09:02.00
Up in the upper right-hand corner

221
00:09:02.00 --> 00:09:03.03
you see where it says Log Out,

222
00:09:03.03 --> 00:09:07.05
with SAML, I can actually,
I'm already automatically

223
00:09:07.05 --> 00:09:10.00
logged in, that's the beautiful
part about single sign-on

224
00:09:10.00 --> 00:09:13.08
but I could also log
out of just this web app

225
00:09:13.08 --> 00:09:17.00
or I could log out of all
web apps in one big shot.

226
00:09:17.00 --> 00:09:20.00
Now when we're talking
about single sign-on,

227
00:09:20.00 --> 00:09:22.04
especially for the exam,
you need to think about

228
00:09:22.04 --> 00:09:25.07
what type of security
needs you're going to need.

229
00:09:25.07 --> 00:09:28.09
For example, if we're talking
about a local area of network

230
00:09:28.09 --> 00:09:32.03
where you just want to be able
to share folders and files,

231
00:09:32.03 --> 00:09:35.01
you're gonna have to be using
Windows Active Directory.

232
00:09:35.01 --> 00:09:38.02
Yes there are other options
but Windows AD is dominant.

233
00:09:38.02 --> 00:09:42.01
But the moment you start
talking about SCADA systems

234
00:09:42.01 --> 00:09:44.06
or anything that's widespread
or all over the place,

235
00:09:44.06 --> 00:09:48.06
be sure to think SAML and
you'll get it right on the exam.
