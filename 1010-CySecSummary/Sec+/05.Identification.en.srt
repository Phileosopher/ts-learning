1
00:00:00.02 --> 00:00:02.03
- Well, what I wanna cover in this episode

2
00:00:02.03 --> 00:00:06.05
is identification, authorization,
and authentication.

3
00:00:06.05 --> 00:00:09.01
Now, when we talk about
these three, the best way

4
00:00:09.01 --> 00:00:11.03
to really understand it
is through an analogy.

5
00:00:11.03 --> 00:00:14.04
So, I'm actually buying myself
a ticket to go to the theater

6
00:00:14.04 --> 00:00:18.08
right now, and I'm gonna print
out my confirmation code.

7
00:00:18.08 --> 00:00:20.00
Let's go to the theater, and let me

8
00:00:20.00 --> 00:00:23.00
show ya how these three work.

9
00:00:23.00 --> 00:00:26.01
Two tickets for La traviata, please.

10
00:00:26.01 --> 00:00:28.05
Now, before she's gonna
give me any tickets,

11
00:00:28.05 --> 00:00:31.02
we are gonna have to get,
in essence, authenticated.

12
00:00:31.02 --> 00:00:33.05
Now, the first step I'm
gonna have to do here

13
00:00:33.05 --> 00:00:36.05
is I'm gonna have to provide
some form of identification.

14
00:00:36.05 --> 00:00:39.04
In this case, I'm just gonna
provide a driver's license.

15
00:00:39.04 --> 00:00:41.07
Now, because the ticket
lady's a human being,

16
00:00:41.07 --> 00:00:43.08
this is an easy way
for her to identify me,

17
00:00:43.08 --> 00:00:46.01
is just by looking at
the driver's license.

18
00:00:46.01 --> 00:00:48.02
But, it still doesn't
mean I'm authenticated

19
00:00:48.02 --> 00:00:49.05
to get some tickets.

20
00:00:49.05 --> 00:00:51.05
In order for me to do, ah, yes,

21
00:00:51.05 --> 00:00:53.04
in order for me to do that, I'm gonna have

22
00:00:53.04 --> 00:00:55.04
to pull out my confirmation number

23
00:00:55.04 --> 00:00:57.08
that I printed out on my printer earlier.

24
00:00:57.08 --> 00:01:01.06
Now, between my identification
and my confirmation number,

25
00:01:01.06 --> 00:01:04.09
I've actually performed
proper authentication.

26
00:01:04.09 --> 00:01:07.06
Thank you very much.

27
00:01:07.06 --> 00:01:09.01
And now, I've got my tickets.

28
00:01:09.01 --> 00:01:13.08
Let's go sit down.

29
00:01:13.08 --> 00:01:16.01
OK, row T,

30
00:01:16.01 --> 00:01:20.00
and my seats are 14 and 15.

31
00:01:20.00 --> 00:01:23.07
OK, looks good.

32
00:01:23.07 --> 00:01:26.09
I think I might be here a little early.

33
00:01:26.09 --> 00:01:28.09
The important thing to
remember for the Security+

34
00:01:28.09 --> 00:01:31.05
is the difference between identification,

35
00:01:31.05 --> 00:01:33.09
authentication, and authorization.

36
00:01:33.09 --> 00:01:36.01
Identification just proves who I am

37
00:01:36.01 --> 00:01:38.01
to the authenticating system.

38
00:01:38.01 --> 00:01:40.07
Authentication itself
takes place by me proving

39
00:01:40.07 --> 00:01:43.06
that I have rights to that
system through passwords,

40
00:01:43.06 --> 00:01:47.03
smart cards, retinal scanners,
whatever it might be.

41
00:01:47.03 --> 00:01:51.04
And then, authorization
simply means what rights

42
00:01:51.04 --> 00:01:55.01
do I have to the system once
I've been authenticated.

43
00:01:55.01 --> 00:01:58.04
Alright, so, let's do this all
over again, except this time,

44
00:01:58.04 --> 00:02:00.07
let's do it in a more
computer kinda world.

45
00:02:00.07 --> 00:02:04.07
I'm gonna watch the show.

46
00:02:04.07 --> 00:02:06.02
Ah, La traviata.

47
00:02:06.02 --> 00:02:09.04
Who doesn't enjoy a little bit
of Verdi every now and then.

48
00:02:09.04 --> 00:02:11.06
OK, well, anyway, we're
back in the studio now,

49
00:02:11.06 --> 00:02:14.07
and what I wanna do is kinda
make sure we understand

50
00:02:14.07 --> 00:02:18.02
there are some issues when
it comes to identification,

51
00:02:18.02 --> 00:02:20.05
authorization, and authentication.

52
00:02:20.05 --> 00:02:21.05
The challenge we have is that,

53
00:02:21.05 --> 00:02:24.00
well, computers aren't people.

54
00:02:24.00 --> 00:02:25.07
I can't go up to a lady in a ticket booth

55
00:02:25.07 --> 00:02:28.03
and just show 'em a driver's
license and confirmation

56
00:02:28.03 --> 00:02:30.08
number and, in essence, get my tickets.

57
00:02:30.08 --> 00:02:32.02
Instead, what we do is we have

58
00:02:32.02 --> 00:02:34.03
what are called authentication factors.

59
00:02:34.03 --> 00:02:36.09
Now, there are three big
authentication factors

60
00:02:36.09 --> 00:02:39.01
that you're gonna be seeing on Security+.

61
00:02:39.01 --> 00:02:41.07
The first one is something you know,

62
00:02:41.07 --> 00:02:43.01
and that's something like a password,

63
00:02:43.01 --> 00:02:45.03
for example, would be something you know.

64
00:02:45.03 --> 00:02:47.04
The next one is something you have,

65
00:02:47.04 --> 00:02:49.07
and that means things like a smart card

66
00:02:49.07 --> 00:02:51.06
or something that you
actually have on your person

67
00:02:51.06 --> 00:02:54.03
that you can use to authorize you.

68
00:02:54.03 --> 00:02:56.05
And the last one is something about you,

69
00:02:56.05 --> 00:02:58.01
and that's what we call biometrics.

70
00:02:58.01 --> 00:03:00.07
That's gonna be things
like retinal scanners

71
00:03:00.07 --> 00:03:03.05
and things that actually measure the veins

72
00:03:03.05 --> 00:03:06.02
in your palm, all kinds
of cool stuff like that.

73
00:03:06.02 --> 00:03:08.02
Anyway, let's go ahead and
start with the first one,

74
00:03:08.02 --> 00:03:10.04
and that is something you know.

75
00:03:10.04 --> 00:03:15.04
So, the best example
is good old passwords.

76
00:03:15.04 --> 00:03:17.09
So, here we are at a
typical log in screen,

77
00:03:17.09 --> 00:03:20.01
and you can see that I have my username

78
00:03:20.01 --> 00:03:21.07
that I type in and my passwords,

79
00:03:21.07 --> 00:03:24.07
we're all pretty comfortable
with something like that.

80
00:03:24.07 --> 00:03:28.09
But passwords aren't the only
type of something you know.

81
00:03:28.09 --> 00:03:33.06
Another great example
are gonna be PIN codes.

82
00:03:33.06 --> 00:03:36.04
Now, we see PINs all over the place.

83
00:03:36.04 --> 00:03:39.02
One of my favorite ones is
here on my phone right here.

84
00:03:39.02 --> 00:03:41.03
So, what I'm gonna do is,

85
00:03:41.03 --> 00:03:43.05
uh, you guys are gonna
fuzz all this out, right?

86
00:03:43.05 --> 00:03:45.06
OK, so, what I'm gonna do
is punch in my password.

87
00:03:45.06 --> 00:03:48.04
One, two, three four,
it's not a password, Mike,

88
00:03:48.04 --> 00:03:50.08
it's a PIN, yeah, I know, it's OK.

89
00:03:50.08 --> 00:03:55.06
Oo, it's incorrect.

90
00:03:55.06 --> 00:03:57.08
Like I was really gonna let
you guys see my PIN code?

91
00:03:57.08 --> 00:03:59.00
Come on.

92
00:03:59.00 --> 00:04:00.09
Now, we see PINs all over the place.

93
00:04:00.09 --> 00:04:04.00
We see 'em on phones a lot, ATM machines,

94
00:04:04.00 --> 00:04:07.03
but, again, that's a great
example of something you know.

95
00:04:07.03 --> 00:04:10.02
In fact, for certain
Department of Justice folks

96
00:04:10.02 --> 00:04:12.09
I work with, not only, when
you walk up to a machine,

97
00:04:12.09 --> 00:04:14.02
do you have to type in a password,

98
00:04:14.02 --> 00:04:15.06
but you actually have to type in a PIN

99
00:04:15.06 --> 00:04:17.04
separately, depending on what type of

100
00:04:17.04 --> 00:04:19.08
authenticating system you might have.

101
00:04:19.08 --> 00:04:22.01
But that's not the only
types of something you know.

102
00:04:22.01 --> 00:04:23.08
There's two more I wanna look at.

103
00:04:23.08 --> 00:04:28.06
First of all, let's
take a look at captcha.

104
00:04:28.06 --> 00:04:31.05
We've probably all seen a captcha screen.

105
00:04:31.05 --> 00:04:34.05
Most the time, these tend
to pop up on websites

106
00:04:34.05 --> 00:04:37.01
where you're logging in
a few too many times,

107
00:04:37.01 --> 00:04:39.01
and you're making the authenticating

108
00:04:39.01 --> 00:04:40.09
process a little bit nervous.

109
00:04:40.09 --> 00:04:42.04
So, what they're gonna do
is they're gonna let you

110
00:04:42.04 --> 00:04:44.07
type in your username and password again,

111
00:04:44.07 --> 00:04:46.09
but you're gonna have
to type in the captcha.

112
00:04:46.09 --> 00:04:50.02
You know what that captcha says.

113
00:04:50.02 --> 00:04:53.00
The idea here is that it's
preventing evil computer

114
00:04:53.00 --> 00:04:55.02
programs that can just keep
logging in over and over

115
00:04:55.02 --> 00:04:57.09
again from being able to log in.

116
00:04:57.09 --> 00:04:59.04
So, that's captcha.

117
00:04:59.04 --> 00:05:03.00
Now, the last one I wanna
take a look at is right here,

118
00:05:03.00 --> 00:05:05.04
and this is going to
be security questions.

119
00:05:05.04 --> 00:05:07.06
And there's a good chance most of us

120
00:05:07.06 --> 00:05:09.06
have seen security questions too.

121
00:05:09.06 --> 00:05:11.08
Security questions usually
pop up, for example,

122
00:05:11.08 --> 00:05:14.05
when you've forgotten your
password or something like this,

123
00:05:14.05 --> 00:05:16.00
and it allows for an automatic

124
00:05:16.00 --> 00:05:18.01
password-retrieval-type system

125
00:05:18.01 --> 00:05:22.02
simply by you remembering
the name of your first dog

126
00:05:22.02 --> 00:05:25.09
or your mother's maiden
name, or your school

127
00:05:25.09 --> 00:05:30.01
that you graduated from,
whatever it might be.

128
00:05:30.01 --> 00:05:31.02
So, you need to be careful

129
00:05:31.02 --> 00:05:33.05
on the Security+ exam right here.

130
00:05:33.05 --> 00:05:35.06
It's easy to remember
that something you know

131
00:05:35.06 --> 00:05:38.03
would be an example like
a password or a PIN.

132
00:05:38.03 --> 00:05:41.01
But also remember that
captcha and security

133
00:05:41.01 --> 00:05:44.05
questions are included
in something you know.

134
00:05:44.05 --> 00:05:47.05
OK, the next one is something you have.

135
00:05:47.05 --> 00:05:49.04
Now, when we talk about
something you have,

136
00:05:49.04 --> 00:05:51.02
we're gonna talk about
two things in particular

137
00:05:51.02 --> 00:05:53.00
that you're gonna see on Security+

138
00:05:53.00 --> 00:05:54.06
The first one is called a smart card,

139
00:05:54.06 --> 00:05:57.08
and I seem to be out of
smart cards right now,

140
00:05:57.08 --> 00:05:59.03
but I got a picture of
one here on the screen.

141
00:05:59.03 --> 00:06:00.06
Let's take a look at this.

142
00:06:00.06 --> 00:06:03.07
Now, this is a very typical
smart card that you'll see used

143
00:06:03.07 --> 00:06:06.07
in a lot of federal organizations
and stuff like that.

144
00:06:06.07 --> 00:06:08.07
The important thing about a smart card

145
00:06:08.07 --> 00:06:11.03
is embedded somewhere on that smart card

146
00:06:11.03 --> 00:06:15.04
is a chip that holds a
unique identifying code.

147
00:06:15.04 --> 00:06:18.08
And when you insert this,
or when you wave it over

148
00:06:18.08 --> 00:06:20.07
a sensor or whatever it might be,

149
00:06:20.07 --> 00:06:24.04
it provides that code to
the authenticating body.

150
00:06:24.04 --> 00:06:26.02
Now, smart cards are
great, but the last one

151
00:06:26.02 --> 00:06:29.01
I wanna show you is known as an RSA key.

152
00:06:29.01 --> 00:06:32.04
Now, an RSA key, it can be a little device

153
00:06:32.04 --> 00:06:35.06
that is got a number, or it
can be a piece of software.

154
00:06:35.06 --> 00:06:37.01
And I actually have one here,

155
00:06:37.01 --> 00:06:41.00
so let me show ya how an RSA key works.

156
00:06:41.00 --> 00:06:43.01
Now, I want you to
watch this very closely.

157
00:06:43.01 --> 00:06:45.08
You'll see this eight-digit code, watch.

158
00:06:45.08 --> 00:06:48.01
OK, you see it just change?

159
00:06:48.01 --> 00:06:53.05
An RSA token or an RSA
key is a piece of software

160
00:06:53.05 --> 00:06:56.06
or an actual physical key you can get

161
00:06:56.06 --> 00:07:00.09
that stores a secret code of some form.

162
00:07:00.09 --> 00:07:03.01
It then takes that
secret code and performs

163
00:07:03.01 --> 00:07:06.07
some magic little voodoo
on it and will generate

164
00:07:06.07 --> 00:07:10.07
a value that changes, it depends,
there's no law of physics,

165
00:07:10.07 --> 00:07:13.02
every 30 seconds, every 60 seconds.

166
00:07:13.02 --> 00:07:17.00
So, the only way that another
device can authenticate

167
00:07:17.00 --> 00:07:20.00
this is that if it also
has that secret code.

168
00:07:20.00 --> 00:07:22.05
And it will go ahead and
run the same mumbo jumbo,

169
00:07:22.05 --> 00:07:24.06
and if it comes up with the same value,

170
00:07:24.06 --> 00:07:26.06
you are in good shape.

171
00:07:26.06 --> 00:07:29.03
Now, the last one is something about you.

172
00:07:29.03 --> 00:07:30.08
And when we talk about
something about you,

173
00:07:30.08 --> 00:07:33.02
we're talking about something
about you physically.

174
00:07:33.02 --> 00:07:36.09
So, we could have fingerprint
scanners or iris patterns

175
00:07:36.09 --> 00:07:39.03
or even the pattern of
the veins in your wrist

176
00:07:39.03 --> 00:07:42.04
can be used to identify you uniquely.

177
00:07:42.04 --> 00:07:44.00
Now, there's a bunch of
these that are out there.

178
00:07:44.00 --> 00:07:46.02
If you've got a late-generation iPhone 5,

179
00:07:46.02 --> 00:07:48.08
there's fingerprint scanners
and things like that.

180
00:07:48.08 --> 00:07:55.04
But what I have here is my
buddy Scott has a cool laptop,

181
00:07:55.04 --> 00:08:01.06
and on this laptop is facial recognition.

182
00:08:01.06 --> 00:08:04.05
So, to use this, all I'm gonna have to do,

183
00:08:04.05 --> 00:08:07.01
and this allows him to
log into his laptop,

184
00:08:07.01 --> 00:08:10.06
so, what I'm gonna do here is
I'm gonna fire the laptop up.

185
00:08:10.06 --> 00:08:12.04
So, on his laptop, he's actually just

186
00:08:12.04 --> 00:08:15.00
using the camera here to recognize me.

187
00:08:15.00 --> 00:08:15.08
Now, if you look on the screen,

188
00:08:15.08 --> 00:08:17.08
you see it's actually trying
to find Scott Jernigan,

189
00:08:17.08 --> 00:08:19.07
so we might have a bit of a problem.

190
00:08:19.07 --> 00:08:21.05
- [Scott] Hey, where's my laptop?

191
00:08:21.05 --> 00:08:22.07
- [Mike] Oh, sorry Scott.

192
00:08:22.07 --> 00:08:24.00
- [Scott] Mike.

193
00:08:24.00 --> 00:08:25.01
- [Mike] I was just tryin' to show people

194
00:08:25.01 --> 00:08:28.04
how Security+ covers things
like something you are.

195
00:08:28.04 --> 00:08:29.06
- Pretty slick, huh, Mike?

196
00:08:29.06 --> 00:08:30.04
- It is slick.

197
00:08:30.04 --> 00:08:33.06
Thank you for letting
me steal your laptop.

198
00:08:33.06 --> 00:08:35.07
- Thanks, uh, ya all done?

199
00:08:35.07 --> 00:08:37.06
- We're done, we're done,
take it away, Jeeves.

200
00:08:37.06 --> 00:08:38.09
(laptop closing)

201
00:08:38.09 --> 00:08:39.07
- Bye.

202
00:08:39.07 --> 00:08:44.02
- Bye, look forward to stealing
more from you in the future.

203
00:08:44.02 --> 00:08:48.07
OK, so, that is a great
example of something about you.

204
00:08:48.07 --> 00:08:51.01
Now, there are two more on the Security+

205
00:08:51.01 --> 00:08:52.04
we need to talk about.

206
00:08:52.04 --> 00:08:55.02
One of them is called something you do.

207
00:08:55.02 --> 00:08:57.00
And when we talk about something you do,

208
00:08:57.00 --> 00:08:58.09
there are actually authentication programs

209
00:08:58.09 --> 00:09:02.00
where if you log in your
password, for example,

210
00:09:02.00 --> 00:09:04.05
not only do you have to
have the right password,

211
00:09:04.05 --> 00:09:06.05
but, literally, the rhythm of your typing

212
00:09:06.05 --> 00:09:09.02
can be used to verify that it's actually

213
00:09:09.02 --> 00:09:12.00
your kinda typing style,
which is pretty cool.

214
00:09:12.00 --> 00:09:13.03
Now, the last one I wanna talk

215
00:09:13.03 --> 00:09:15.09
about is called somewhere you are.

216
00:09:15.09 --> 00:09:17.03
And when we talk about somewhere you are,

217
00:09:17.03 --> 00:09:19.08
as it implies, it has
to do with geography.

218
00:09:19.08 --> 00:09:21.06
So, the best way to show you this

219
00:09:21.06 --> 00:09:24.01
is let's go buy some gasoline.

220
00:09:24.01 --> 00:09:27.05
Now, somewhere you are has to do, well,

221
00:09:27.05 --> 00:09:29.08
we see it in a lotta
places on authentication,

222
00:09:29.08 --> 00:09:33.02
but one place we see it a lot
is in the credit card world.

223
00:09:33.02 --> 00:09:34.00
(keypad beeping)

224
00:09:34.00 --> 00:09:36.02
For example, here I am buying gas,

225
00:09:36.02 --> 00:09:39.07
and it wants me to enter my zip code.

226
00:09:39.07 --> 00:09:41.06
(pump beeping)

227
00:09:41.06 --> 00:09:43.03
Hey, it works.

228
00:09:43.03 --> 00:09:46.01
So, I'm gonna put regular in here.

229
00:09:46.01 --> 00:09:49.05
Now,

230
00:09:49.05 --> 00:09:51.01
the other thing to
remember about somewhere

231
00:09:51.01 --> 00:09:52.07
you are is that this is also used

232
00:09:52.07 --> 00:09:55.04
by credit card companies to detect fraud.

233
00:09:55.04 --> 00:09:58.01
So, for example, while I'm
here in Houston, Texas,

234
00:09:58.01 --> 00:09:59.07
if someone else were
trying to use this card

235
00:09:59.07 --> 00:10:02.01
in Chattanooga, Tennessee,
that would definitely

236
00:10:02.01 --> 00:10:04.05
set off some alarms at
the credit card company.

237
00:10:04.05 --> 00:10:06.01
Those are the types of authentication

238
00:10:06.01 --> 00:10:08.06
or, really, identifications,
that we run into.

239
00:10:08.06 --> 00:10:12.03
So, the challenge that
we start to get is that

240
00:10:12.03 --> 00:10:15.08
we do a lot of authenticating
all over the place,

241
00:10:15.08 --> 00:10:18.03
and if I've got one network over here,

242
00:10:18.03 --> 00:10:20.00
and then there's a company, and we access

243
00:10:20.00 --> 00:10:23.05
their data a lot for
some reason or another,

244
00:10:23.05 --> 00:10:25.06
the hassle of authenticating
from one place

245
00:10:25.06 --> 00:10:27.09
and then another can
be a bit of a problem.

246
00:10:27.09 --> 00:10:29.05
So, with a lot of operating systems,

247
00:10:29.05 --> 00:10:31.04
in fact, well, let me rephrase that,

248
00:10:31.04 --> 00:10:33.09
with Microsoft Windows in particular,

249
00:10:33.09 --> 00:10:38.00
we can actually create
authentications based on trust.

250
00:10:38.00 --> 00:10:40.07
So, here I've got three
different networks.

251
00:10:40.07 --> 00:10:43.02
And, in this particular situation,

252
00:10:43.02 --> 00:10:44.06
these are three different companies

253
00:10:44.06 --> 00:10:47.02
that access this one company's database.

254
00:10:47.02 --> 00:10:50.00
So, what becomes interesting
is that we can set up

255
00:10:50.00 --> 00:10:53.05
what are known as a
federated trust situation.

256
00:10:53.05 --> 00:10:57.06
And when we say federated
trust, it's basically

257
00:10:57.06 --> 00:10:59.07
this system saying to
this system if you've got

258
00:10:59.07 --> 00:11:02.07
somebody you trust, then
I'll trust 'em as well.

259
00:11:02.07 --> 00:11:04.08
And what we can do, and
this sets up in Windows

260
00:11:04.08 --> 00:11:07.05
fascinatingly under Active
Directory, is we can set

261
00:11:07.05 --> 00:11:09.05
something up, and we can
actually establish a trust.

262
00:11:09.05 --> 00:11:11.08
We can connect to another Windows domain

263
00:11:11.08 --> 00:11:14.05
and say this domain trusts this domain,

264
00:11:14.05 --> 00:11:17.02
and it can automatically
create these types

265
00:11:17.02 --> 00:11:20.03
of federated, transitive trusts.

266
00:11:20.03 --> 00:11:22.05
The last thing to throw
in here is the idea

267
00:11:22.05 --> 00:11:25.03
of what we call
multifactor authentication.

268
00:11:25.03 --> 00:11:27.07
You would never, ever use a biometric

269
00:11:27.07 --> 00:11:30.09
as a primary and only
source of authentication.

270
00:11:30.09 --> 00:11:32.06
Typically, what you're
gonna do is pretty much

271
00:11:32.06 --> 00:11:34.08
everything works with a
username and password,

272
00:11:34.08 --> 00:11:36.02
or it could be a PIN number.

273
00:11:36.02 --> 00:11:38.08
So, if you're gonna
authenticate on a system,

274
00:11:38.08 --> 00:11:42.03
you're going to use a fingerprint scanner,

275
00:11:42.03 --> 00:11:44.01
and you're gonna type in
a username and password.

276
00:11:44.01 --> 00:11:45.06
You're gonna type in a
username and password,

277
00:11:45.06 --> 00:11:47.04
and you're gonna use a hardware token.

278
00:11:47.04 --> 00:11:50.00
So, we're always doing the multifactor

279
00:11:50.00 --> 00:11:51.03
form of authentication.
