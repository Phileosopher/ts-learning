1
00:00:01.01 --> 00:00:03.09
- To understand how RADIUS
works, what I want to start off

2
00:00:03.09 --> 00:00:06.05
with are these three blocks,
and these three blocks

3
00:00:06.05 --> 00:00:09.07
are gonna represent
three different devices.

4
00:00:09.07 --> 00:00:12.02
Now way over here on the right,

5
00:00:12.02 --> 00:00:15.01
we're gonna have a RADIUS server.

6
00:00:15.01 --> 00:00:18.05
Now a RADIUS server is just
a system that's running

7
00:00:18.05 --> 00:00:21.05
some type of RADIUS
authentication software.

8
00:00:21.05 --> 00:00:24.08
There's Microsoft IAS.

9
00:00:24.08 --> 00:00:28.01
There's third-party tools
like Steel-Belted Radius.

10
00:00:28.01 --> 00:00:31.00
There are open-source
ones like OpenRADIUS.

11
00:00:31.00 --> 00:00:33.04
So it's some type of
authentication software

12
00:00:33.04 --> 00:00:35.04
that's running on a system here.

13
00:00:35.04 --> 00:00:38.08
Now the next thing you're going
to have is a RADIUS client.

14
00:00:38.08 --> 00:00:40.08
Now the RADIUS client is not who's

15
00:00:40.08 --> 00:00:42.08
actually being authenticated.

16
00:00:42.08 --> 00:00:45.04
His job is to handle authentication

17
00:00:45.04 --> 00:00:48.09
requests from RADIUS supplicants.

18
00:00:48.09 --> 00:00:51.04
So these are the guys who
want to get authenticated.

19
00:00:51.04 --> 00:00:53.08
He's just the intermediary that makes

20
00:00:53.08 --> 00:00:56.02
the request to the server itself.

21
00:00:56.02 --> 00:01:00.04
So if we take a look at
this, this is gonna be a

22
00:01:00.04 --> 00:01:03.05
let's say we have a wireless
network for example.

23
00:01:03.05 --> 00:01:05.03
So what I could do here,
let's have a little fun,

24
00:01:05.03 --> 00:01:08.07
I'm gonna put a little antenna into him.

25
00:01:08.07 --> 00:01:12.06
There you go, now we've got
a little wireless antenna

26
00:01:12.06 --> 00:01:16.04
to help us appreciate that this
is a wireless access point.

27
00:01:16.04 --> 00:01:18.05
So he'll be set up as a RADIUS client,

28
00:01:18.05 --> 00:01:20.02
and then this RADIUS
server will be over here.

29
00:01:20.02 --> 00:01:22.03
So the supplicant, this
will be just some laptop,

30
00:01:22.03 --> 00:01:23.08
or somebody who's trying to get on,

31
00:01:23.08 --> 00:01:26.04
or a smartphone or something.

32
00:01:26.04 --> 00:01:30.06
He sends his RADIUS request
to the RADIUS client,

33
00:01:30.06 --> 00:01:34.01
who then forwards it to
the RADIUS server itself.

34
00:01:34.01 --> 00:01:35.09
Now the important thing
about a RADIUS server

35
00:01:35.09 --> 00:01:38.09
is that this RADIUS server's
gonna be using certificates,

36
00:01:38.09 --> 00:01:41.07
or user names and
passwords, or RSA tokens,

37
00:01:41.07 --> 00:01:44.03
or something that's coming
from the supplicant.

38
00:01:44.03 --> 00:01:47.06
But the actual database
itself of user names

39
00:01:47.06 --> 00:01:49.06
and passwords or any of that stuff

40
00:01:49.06 --> 00:01:52.03
doesn't have to physically
be on this computer.

41
00:01:52.03 --> 00:01:55.02
In a lot of situations,
this could be like a Windows

42
00:01:55.02 --> 00:01:57.09
domain controller or something
like this, and the RADIUS

43
00:01:57.09 --> 00:02:01.01
server can actually go ahead
and authenticate against

44
00:02:01.01 --> 00:02:04.09
domain names in a domain
account or something like that.

45
00:02:04.09 --> 00:02:08.06
So this is a pretty
standard setup for a RADIUS.

46
00:02:08.06 --> 00:02:10.08
Now the thing you need
to remember about RADIUS

47
00:02:10.08 --> 00:02:13.08
is RADIUS is gonna be running on UDP.

48
00:02:13.08 --> 00:02:21.04
It's gonna be running on port
1812 or 1813 or 1645 or 1646.

49
00:02:21.04 --> 00:02:22.06
Now here's the big thing you need

50
00:02:22.06 --> 00:02:24.02
to keep in mind about all this.

51
00:02:24.02 --> 00:02:29.01
The challenge we're running
into is that RADIUS is AAA.

52
00:02:29.01 --> 00:02:32.06
So it's authentication,
authorization, and accounting.

53
00:02:32.06 --> 00:02:35.05
So it authenticates people,
it authorizes and determines

54
00:02:35.05 --> 00:02:38.06
what they can do, and it
keeps track of who does what.

55
00:02:38.06 --> 00:02:42.01
There is another version of AAA that is on

56
00:02:42.01 --> 00:02:44.01
the Network+ that you need to be aware of.

57
00:02:44.01 --> 00:02:46.09
It's called TACACS+.

58
00:02:46.09 --> 00:02:51.06
TACACS+ is actually a
proprietary Cisco product,

59
00:02:51.06 --> 00:02:55.04
and it came to being
because Cisco had a lot

60
00:02:55.04 --> 00:02:57.08
of customers who had routers and switches,

61
00:02:57.08 --> 00:02:59.09
and people were going
nuts having to log in

62
00:02:59.09 --> 00:03:02.09
to all of these different routers
and switches individually,

63
00:03:02.09 --> 00:03:05.09
and they wanted to come
up with a AAA situation

64
00:03:05.09 --> 00:03:08.04
that would allow people
to handle management

65
00:03:08.04 --> 00:03:10.02
of a large number of routers and switches.

66
00:03:10.02 --> 00:03:14.04
And that's where Cisco
came up with TACACS+.

67
00:03:14.04 --> 00:03:16.08
Now I want to do this
again, except this time

68
00:03:16.08 --> 00:03:21.04
let's put some TACACS+
stuff into the game.

69
00:03:21.04 --> 00:03:24.07
Okay so first of all, TACACS+ is

70
00:03:24.07 --> 00:03:26.02
rarely used in a wireless network.

71
00:03:26.02 --> 00:03:29.00
I'm not saying it isn't used,
but it's not very common.

72
00:03:29.00 --> 00:03:32.06
So I'm gonna start off
with the TACACS+ client.

73
00:03:32.06 --> 00:03:34.05
Now what I'm talking
about here as a client,

74
00:03:34.05 --> 00:03:36.08
is this is one of a bazillion different

75
00:03:36.08 --> 00:03:38.01
routers that are in an enterprise.

76
00:03:38.01 --> 00:03:39.07
It could be anything like that.

77
00:03:39.07 --> 00:03:44.00
Now along with that is going
to be a TACACS+ server.

78
00:03:44.00 --> 00:03:46.06
Now this is gonna be some
computer within the enterprise

79
00:03:46.06 --> 00:03:49.01
itself that's keeping
track of all these things.

80
00:03:49.01 --> 00:03:54.02
A TACACS+ user is really just
somebody who's logging into

81
00:03:54.02 --> 00:03:56.06
the network and wants to
get to a bunch of routers.

82
00:03:56.06 --> 00:03:59.01
So the whole idea of
supplicant doesn't really come

83
00:03:59.01 --> 00:04:03.02
into play with TACACS+
like it does with RADIUS.

84
00:04:03.02 --> 00:04:06.04
Not to worry, the one thing
you do need to remember,

85
00:04:06.04 --> 00:04:09.00
and this is gonna be on the Network+,

86
00:04:09.00 --> 00:04:14.00
and that is that TACACS+ uses TCP port 49.

87
00:04:14.00 --> 00:04:16.03
So make sure you always
can appreciate that

88
00:04:16.03 --> 00:04:22.00
TACACS+ uses TCP, and then
RADIUS is gonna use UDP.

89
00:04:22.00 --> 00:04:25.08
So the whole reason we really
talk about RADIUS and TACACS+

90
00:04:25.08 --> 00:04:28.01
at the same time is because the one thing

91
00:04:28.01 --> 00:04:31.00
they do have in common
is they're both AAA.

92
00:04:31.00 --> 00:04:34.08
They both authenticate, they
both authorize, and they both

93
00:04:34.08 --> 00:04:38.03
account, keeping track of who's
doing what, when, and how.
