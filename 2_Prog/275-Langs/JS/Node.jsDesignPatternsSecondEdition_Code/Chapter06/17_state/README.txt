This sample demonstrates how to use the State pattern 
to create a client socket that doesn't break when it loses 
connection with the server.

To install all the dependencies:
  npm install

To try the sample run in two different terminals:
   node server
And then:
   node client

You can try to shutdown (ctrl+c) and restart the server several times to see the state in the client changing from
online to offline and then back to online when the server is resurrected.
