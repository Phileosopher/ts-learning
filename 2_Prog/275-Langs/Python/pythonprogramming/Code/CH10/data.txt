The Time Traveller, for so it will be convenient to speak of him, 
was expounding a recondite matter to us. His grey eyes shone and 
twinkled, and his usually pale face was flushed and animated. The 
fire burned brightly and the soft radiance of the incandescent 
lights in the lilies of silver caught the bubbles that flashed and 
passed in our glasses.
