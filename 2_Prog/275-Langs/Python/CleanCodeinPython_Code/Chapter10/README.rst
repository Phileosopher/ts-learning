Clean code in Python - Chapter 10: Clean architecture
=====================================================

Requirements for running the examples:

    * Docker
    * Python 3.7

There is an example service under the ``service`` directory. Follow its ``Makefile`` and ``README`` instructions to setup.

Check the ``README`` files under ``service/``.

To test with a local database, you will need to create its Docker image.
Instructions for this are at ``service/libs/storage/db/``. This will create the
database image with some testing data on it.
