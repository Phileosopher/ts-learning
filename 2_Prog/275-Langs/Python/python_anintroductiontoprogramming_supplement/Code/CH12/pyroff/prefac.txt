Computer vision has become a high profile subject in recent times.
The reason is clear enough - for those of us who are sighted, most of
the information we acquire day to day is through vision. We are
highly picture oriented beings, as demonstrated by the prevalance of
television, motion pictures, magazenes, and books. Even in science
much of the data has a visual aspect: photographs, spectrograms,
chromatography images, and a host of other visual means of accessing data
pervade all scientific disciplines. Indeed, when data is not visual
we tend to make it so by drawing graphs and charts.
