This is sample text for testing Pyroff. The default is to right adjust 
continuously, but embedded commands can change this.
.ll 30
Now the line width should be 30 characters, and so the left margin will pulled back.
.ce 1
This line is centered
.sp 2
.ti +4
.xx not a command.
Indented 4 characters.
.in 2
The idea behind top-down programming is that the higher levels of abstraction are 
described first. A description of what he entire program is to do is written in a 
kind-of English/computer hybrid language (pseudocode), and this description involves 
making calls to functions that have not yet been written but whose function is known.

When the highest level description is acceptable, then the functions used are described. 
In this way the high level decisions are described in terms of the lower level, whose 
implementation is postponed until the details are appropriate. The process repeats until 
all parts have been described, at which time the translation of the pseudocode into a 
real programming language can proceed, and should be straightforward. This can result 
in many distinct programs, but all should do basically the same thing, simply in somewhat 
different ways.
