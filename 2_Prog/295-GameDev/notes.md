NOTE: games are the "uber" software, since they're so demanding
  needs CONSTANT, immediate feedback
  any network issues need to be resolved very quickly as well
  visually pushes hardware to the limits






NOTE: MUST DEFINE WHAT A "GAME" IS VERSUS MERELY A TOY (CONSULT GIS?)
  I'LL PROBABLY CLARIFY A "GAME" FOR COMPUTER PURPOSES AS BEING:
    "something that requires user input and interacts profoundly much over it, as if it were recreating real life"
    This is because a game development versus interactive physics toy are precisely the same mechanism, but the game goes farther by putting in a few more constraints and things that can clarify purposes
Game dev is actually a ridiculous hybrid of disciplines
  [graphics] development, both 2D and 3D
  [programming], both logical and graphics in response to [input]
