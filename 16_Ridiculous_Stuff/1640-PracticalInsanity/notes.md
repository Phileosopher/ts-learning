  What Languages Fix
    Kevin Kelleher suggested an interesting way to compare programming languages: to describe each in terms of the problem it fixes. The surprising thing is how many, and how well, languages can be described this way.
    Algol: Assembly language is too low-level.
    Pascal: Algol doesn't have enough data types.
    Modula: Pascal is too wimpy for systems programming.
    Simula: Algol isn't good enough at simulations.
    Smalltalk: Not everything in Simula is an object.
    Fortran: Assembly language is too low-level.
    Cobol: Fortran is scary.
    PL/1: Fortran doesn't have enough data types.
    Ada: Every existing language is missing something.
    Basic: Fortran is scary.
    APL: Fortran isn't good enough at manipulating arrays.
    J: APL requires its own character set.
    C: Assembly language is too low-level.
    C++: C is too low-level.
    Java: C++ is a kludge. And Microsoft is going to crush us.
    C#: Java is controlled by Sun.
    Lisp: Turing Machines are an awkward way to describe computation.
    Scheme: MacLisp is a kludge.
    T: Scheme has no libraries.
    Common Lisp: There are too many dialects of Lisp.
    Dylan: Scheme has no libraries, and Lisp syntax is scary.
    Perl: Shell scripts/awk/sed are not enough like programming languages.
    Python: Perl is a kludge.
    Ruby: Perl is a kludge, and Lisp syntax is scary.
    Prolog: Programming is not enough like logic.
You Might Be Into CS...
  If you find Linux a fun thing to do on Friday night
  If you plug in your USB stick correctly EVERY TIME
  If half your friends keep in touch because you know how to use Fn+F7 on their laptop...
  If computer fans help you sleep at night...
  If you're planning to root your car as soon as you can find a firmware leak from GM
  If your alarm clock activates your coffee machine. Remotely.
  If you immediately bring up Newegg when you hear your grandpa has a memory problem.
  If you only write entire words for your boss's boss.
  You confuse people all the time, so you simplify everything, but they're still confused.
  A politician is embroiled in a sex scandal, and you're more upset that he didn't know how to lock their computer.
