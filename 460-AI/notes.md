Python Roadmap
  Here's a Python road-map to take you from complete beginner to advanced with machine learning. I don't know what area of computer science you're interested in (AI, web dev, etc.) but I'd say do everything up to intermediate and then branch off. You'll need everything up to intermediate to have any chance of passing a tech interview if you want to do this as a career. Hopefully, this provides some framework for you to get started on:
  # Beginner
    â€¢ Data Types - Lists, Strings, Tuples, Sets, Floats, Ints, Booleans, Dictionaries
    â€¢ Control Flow/Looping - for loops, while loops, if/elif/else
    â€¢ Arithmetic and expressions
    â€¢ I/O (Input/Output) - Sys module, Standard input/output, reading/writing files  
    â€¢ Functions
    â€¢ Exceptions and Error Handling
    â€¢ Basics of object oriented programming (OOP) (Simple classes).
  # Intermediate
    â€¢ Recursion
    â€¢ More advanced OOP - Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Method overloading.
    â€¢ Data Structures - Linked lists, Stacks, Queues, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, Graphs, Minimum Spanning Trees, Hash Maps
    â€¢ Algorithms - Linear Search, Binary Search, Hashing, Quicksort, Insertion/Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Radix Sort, Depth First Search, Breathe First Search, Prim's Algorithm, Dijkstra's Algorithm.
    â€¢ Algorithmic Complexity
  # Advanced - A.I. / Machine Learning/ Data science
    â€¢ Statistics
    â€¢ Probability
    â€¢ Brute Force search
    â€¢ Heuristic search (Manhattan Distance, Admissible and Informed Heuristics)
    â€¢ Hill Climbing
    â€¢ Simulated Annealing
    â€¢ A* search
    â€¢ Adversarial Search (Minimax & Alpha-Beta pruning)
    â€¢ Greedy Algorithms
    â€¢ Dynamic Programming
    â€¢ Genetic Algorithms
    â€¢ Artificial Neural Networks
    â€¢ Backpropagation
    â€¢ Natural Language Processing
    â€¢ Convolutional Neural Networks
    â€¢ Recurrent Neural Networks
    â€¢ Generative Adversarial Networks
  # Advanced - Full stack web development
    â€¢ Computer networks (Don't need to go into heavy detail but an understanding is necessary)
    â€¢ Backend web dev tools (flask, django) (This is for app logic, interfacing with databases etc).
    â€¢ Front end framework (This is for communicating with the backend) (Angular 6+, React/Redux)
    â€¢ With frontend you'll also need - HTML, CSS, Javascript (also good to learn typescript which is using in angular. It makes writing javascript nicer).
    â€¢ Relational database (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
    â€¢ Non-relational (MongoDB)
    â€¢ Cloud computing knowledge is good, (AWS have a free tier that lasts a year, so its a nice way to get to know how that works

[course] Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning (XCS224N)
  Natural language processing (NLP) is undergoing rapid evolution as new methods and toolsets converge with an ever-expanding availability of data. Our upcoming course, Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning, provides a thorough introduction to the modern neural network algorithms for the processing of linguistic information.
  "I have taken several online courses in AI, and most of them helped me learn something new. But, XCS224N goes right at the top of my list. It is one of the best advanced courses I have taken as it strikes a good balance between theory and practice, beginner and advanced concepts. It makes you work a lot harder than other courses, but the end result is worth it." --Ashish K.
  This cohort-based 10-week course begins June 8, 2020.
