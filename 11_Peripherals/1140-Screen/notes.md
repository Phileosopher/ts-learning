Output - Screen
  NOTE: COLOR LINK HERE FROM GIS?
  In practice, a screen is typically a grid of small dots called "pixels", though there are some notable exceptions:
    At one time, when Atari games were out, they used light bounced from the side of the screen to make lines, which is how they were able to simulate something that felt 3D in 1983
    Certain limited-use computers like clock radios or air conditioner controllers don't NEED much visual display, so the engineers settle for cheap LCDs with shapes that can represent what they want to display 
  To make pixels, programmers use 3 primary light colors: red, blue, green
    They figured out that those 3 colors, when combined, can make ALL other visible light
  Inside the computer, they represent each pixel with 3 24-bit numbers:
    00-ff each for red, blue, and green
  Then, the other 8 bits are used to indicate brightness?????? (NOTE: research this!!!)
  It draws all the pixels REALLY fast
