This example shows how to render on the server a react powered application

Before running the examples you need to install the dependencies with:

  npm install

Then you need to run the server using babel-cli:

  node_modules/.bin/babel-cli server.js

Finally you can point your browser to http://localhost:3000 to see the rendered
app.
