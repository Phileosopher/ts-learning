[TeachYourselfCS3] How to Solve It









THE BASIC STEPS OF A FUNCTION DESIGN RECIPE
  1 From problem analysis to data definitions
  Identify the information that must be represented and how it is represented in the chosen programming language. Forumate data definitions and illustrate them with examples.
  2 Signature, purpose statement, header
  State what kind of data the desired function consumes and produces. Formulate a concise answer to the question WHAT the function computes. Define a stub that lives up to the signature.
  3 Functional examples
  Work through examples that illustrate the function's purpose.
  4 Function template
  Translate the data definitions into an outline of the function
  5 Function definition
  Fill in the gaps in the function template. Exploit the  purpose statement and the examples.
  6 Testing
  Articulate the examples as tests and ensure that the function passes all. Doing so discovers mistakes. Tests also supplement examples in that they help others read and understand the definition when the need arises-and it will arise for any serious program.
NOTE: CONSIDER PULLING FROM "WHAT IS PROGRAMMING" FOR MAKING FUNCTIONS
