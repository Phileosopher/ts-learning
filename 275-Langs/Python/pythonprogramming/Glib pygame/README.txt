README (see Ch 14 in the main text for detailed info on GLIB)

This directory holds the pygame version of Glib. Test 
programs resise in the 'test' directory, along with 
sounds, images, and videos used in demonstrating the
functionality of the library.

To make this generally available to all Python programs
on your computer place a copy in the 'Lib' directory of 
your Python installation.

For example, my Python is located in the directory:

            c:/Python34

The Glib.py file should in this case be placed in:

            c:/Python34/Lib

Now it can be imported from anyplace.
