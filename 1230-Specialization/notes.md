the "hard limits" the tech industry must consider
  i.e., your worldview dramatically changes when you can reprogram your ENTIRE topography and workflow within a few days, instead of a few weeks
  the industry is filled with idealists, which is a natural product of the [specialization(GIS)]
  epigenetics vs genetics
  everyone has "firmware" from birth, and it's 100% non-programmable (GIS Universals)
Computers operate on semi-parallel concepts to reality:
  Privacy vs. security revocation
  Truth vs. data
  Performance vs. function
  Network expansion
  Abstractions
People who are [specialized(GIS)] in the industry will often translate over the concepts
However, because someone can specialize in ONLY Java their entire life, they never realize the inherent volatility of a computer: it's basically a pile of electrical pulses slowly suffering entropic decay
Thus, there's practically a "technologist" [religion(GIS)] that has sprung up
  IDEA: call it {re}ligion? recursion-ligion?
A bunch of idealists, driven by a belief in the perfection of logic
  Tech is a tool, not a religion
    Young people overthinking that technology is the cure for everything
    Tech is the "known", but not the "unknown"
    Thus, technologists over-apply the use cases of it
    e.g., machine learning can't predict the stock market until you can predict how someone will feel
This is fine, but [logic(GIS)] ONLY exists in volatile human minds, or in whatever we call "natural law", and many technologists are atheist
It's an issue, because it dictates how we see the world at large and, naturally, the things we build and how we build them
Thus, "leave the philosophy to the philosophers" is dramatically [understating its necessity (philosophy GIS)]
APPLICATION
Tech will NEVER replace humanity
  creativity isn't a computer-based thing, at least not in the "unknown knowns"
  all computers can do is what they're told, even if what they're told is an approximate
  humans, on the other hand, do all SORTS of things they're never told, it's how we find our purposes!
Computers can only magnify human purposes, not redefine them
  Adding technology to something only gives more [power(GIS)], not necessarily answers or clarity
Technology makes us pussies
  By using technology, life gets easier
  When we grow up with technology, we don't  consider carefully how we had lived without it
  Life is more meaningful by living without technology, because it makes us grateful for the things we had taken for granted
Tech people suffer from Dunning-Kruger in other domains
  Technology is so powerful on its own that technology enthusiasts often forget that it's also psychological
  There's MANY aspects of this
  Form
    Interface design is the digital version of physical interfacing
  Function
    We should know right away what the thing should "do"
  Senses
    NOTE: GO THROUGH AL AWARENESS SENSES LIST
    Sight: visual display
      Chopped up into "pixels" as a grid
        this is the most versatile, with the entire computer assembling the instructions SUUUUPER fast
          i.e., if it can break 30 FPS draw rate, it maintains a clear illusion that it's "moving"
        one notable exception being vector graphics (old Atari games)

    Taste/smell
Feelings > Thoughts
  Most STEM treat themselves as brains-first, then sentiments
  This can't be true, since there's always an oriignal feeling that drove them, even when they were 5 years old and wanted to see what that computer did
  Thus, this feelings-based essence interferes with their ability to forecast
    ML is only attainable on the concrete "knowable", which doesn't include the stock market
    Language is an emotional set of expressions that are codified
  This creates a dramatic restructuring of philosophical basis
    We'll have a sooner chance of creating brain transplants than parsing language 100% correctly
