  Parity
    ASCII is 7-bit code, and leaves 1 byte spare, which can be used to implement parity (i.e., error-checking
    If, for whatever reason, the 0 or 1 is flipped, parity can check it
    Parity is basically "odd parity" or "even parity"
      in odd parity, the number is used to make the total of the bits odd  (for 1001001, parity bit is 0)
      in even parity, the number is ued to make  the total of the bits even (for 1001001, parity bit is 1)
    a parity error means the information gets resent
