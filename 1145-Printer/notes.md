  Printers functionally work the same way, but instead of using visible light it's reflected light
  Thus, the complementary colors are used: cyan, magenta, yellow
  The idea is the same, though, for how a computer does it
    1 Computer sends the document out to the "print spooler" [process(OS)]
    2 print spooler breaks it down, line by line, per the instructions for the printer driver
    3 printer receives the information piece-by-piece and does its printing with it
  Printers can use ink, but many office printers use toner instead
    Toner is made of tiny balls of dried powder ink (RESEARCH THIS!)
    1 spray the toner dust evenly on the page
    2 use a laser or some other heating element to melt the toner to make letters and images, line-by-line
    3 blow off the dust and gather it for reuse, cooling the page at the same time
  Most of your rinky-dink daily-use printers for receipts, though, just use a special heat-sensitive paper and a heating element
    Expose a receipt to direct sunlight or a space heater, and it'll turn black
  Screens and printers do the opposite for colors
    Screens use additive colors (red, blue, green) to combine the wavelengths
    Printers use subtractive colors (red, cyan, magenta, "key"(black)) to combine the REFLECTED wavelengths
    NOTE: USE ON BOTH PRINTERS/SCREEN PAGES?
