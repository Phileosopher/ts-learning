A "console" can also be called a "terminal" or "shell" or "command prompt", depending on where and what
Consoles are used for MANY purposes
  basically, they allow both input (via keyboard) and output (on the screen where you just typed)
  simple, but effective
  generally, the console is WAAAY more efficient because it gives MUCH more information than most [UIs] are programmed to do
  however, nowadays the console is hidden or nonexistent
    you can sometimes see the console blink up for half a second when it performs, often when booting up a computer
A computer is, by its nature, a multitool with built-in tools (aka "commands"). With only a little curiosity and experience, most people discover them immediately.
A computer has an extensible design _built_ for replacing parts. The meatspace analogue is a Swiss Army Knife where you can enlarge or remove the corkscrew, attach a chainsaw or secure a nuclear-powered rocket engine to it.
