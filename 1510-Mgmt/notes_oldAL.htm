[OLD AL] - Management 1 Leaders' Attributes
  <li>Momentum is a leader's best friend</li>
  </ul>
  <p>People listen when a legitimate leader speaks</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Anyone can direct what to do, but a leader sees the long-term purpose</li>
  <li>Leaders inspire passions in others before asking for help</li>
  <li>The people closest to a leader define that leader's potential</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Leaders can choose several ways to interpret their role</h3>
  <p>Believing no single leadership style fits all situations and must adapt to situation, context, and followers<br />Letting circumstances define what they should or shouldn't do<br />A leader and follower are in a transaction where the follower will pass or fail the leader's commands and receive reward or punishment for it<br />A leader and follower are in a relationship where the leader should inspire and motivate each follower to success</p>
  <h3>Leadership positions don't always have leaders working in them</h3>
  <p>Most cultures forbid promoting someone and then forcefully demoting them later</p>
  <ul>
  <li>A competent worker often gets promoted until they're no longer capable, which proves the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peter Principle</span></a>: anything that works will be used in progressively more challenging applications until it fails</li>
  <li>Honoring impotent authority is morally necessary, but worth considering an alternative or workaround</li>
  <li>Promotions come more frequently from preference than talent</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>All leaders usually fail on at least a few elements</h3>
  <p>Not enough energy or enthusiasm to motivate others<br />Accepting mediocrity in personal tasks<br />No clear vision or direction<br />Bad judgment with large decisions<br />Unwilling to hear subordinates' input<br />Leading by speaking but not from example<br />Resisting new ideas<br />Not learning from mistakes and failures<br />Poor <a href="http://philosaccounting.com/a/how-to-get-along-with-others/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interpersonal skills</span></a><br />Failing to help others grow, improve or succeed</p>

  <h3>Leadership has many functioning theories</h3>
  <h4>Action Centered Leadership</h4>
  <p>Separates Tasks, Teams, and Individuals</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Leaders need a Task to exist</li>
  <li>The quality of leadership is from how well a leader understanding how to accomplish a Task</li>
  <li>A leader's job is to encourage the Team, who is a group devoted to the Task</li>
  <li>Each Individual's various desires, fears, motivations, and experiences uniquely change how the leader can encourage them</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Blake-Mouton Managerial Grid</h4>
  <p>Separates leaders into Concerned for People and Concerned for Tasks/Results</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Concerned for People leaders focus on group members' benefits, what members enjoy the most, and the greatest benefits to their careers</li>
  <li>Concerned for Tasks/Results leaders are determined to get the job done as successfully as possible and only think about the organization's benefits</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The two competing ideas form a measurable model on two axes<br /><img class="size-medium wp-image-10781 alignnone" src="https://philosaccounting.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/blakemoutongrid3.jpg?w=300" alt="blakemoutongrid3" width="300" height="292" /></p>
  <ul>
  <li>Impoverished management fails both on tasks and helping people</li>
  <li>Country Club management fails on tasks, but workers love to be part of the organization</li>
  <li>Produce or Perish management focuses exclusively on the task and disregards employees' well-being</li>
  <li>Team Leadership offers both, but providing fully for both of them is impossible in reality, meaning Middle of the Road is usually a worthy balance</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Dunham & Pierce's Leadership Process Model</h4>
  <p>Addresses how every element which plays a role in leadership connects with each other<br />The model demarcates several significant factors</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Leader - in charge of a project or team a group answers to, no matter what their title is</li>
  <li>Followers - people mostly responsible for results led by the Leader</li>
  <li>Context - circumstances for the Leader to manage the team, which include the project length and management capabilities</li>
  <li>Outcomes - results of performing a project</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All leadership aspects interconnect with a circular relationship, not a linear one, through other aspects</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Relationships must grow between the Leader and Followers</li>
  <li>People tend to apply their natural skills and ignore other assigned responsibilities</li>
  <li>Since everything connects with other elements, Feedback is critical</li>
  <li>Everything will only stay in harmony with ethical and honest behavior</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Fiedler's Contingency Model</h4>
  <p>Observes how circumstances change from various leadership styles and approaches<br />A leader can only lead in a style based on their personality, meaning a different needed leadership style requires a different leader<br />Rank a potential leader on many values from 1 to 8 on how they interpreted their Least-Preferred Co-Worker</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Unfriendly to Friendly</li>
  <li>Unpleasant to Pleasant</li>
  <li>Rejecting to Accepting</li>
  <li>Tense to Relaxed</li>
  <li>Cold to Warm</li>
  <li>Boring to Interesting</li>
  <li>Backbiting to Loyal</li>
  <li>Uncooperative to Cooperative</li>
  <li>Hostile to Supportive</li>
  <li>Guarded to Open</li>
  <li>Insincere to Sincere</li>
  <li>Unkind to Kind</li>
  <li>Inconsiderate to Considerate</li>
  <li>Untrustworthy to Trustworthy</li>
  <li>Gloomy to Cheerful</li>
  <li>Quarrelsome to Harmonious</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Next, measure the Situational Favorableness to determine how a leader will perform in a situation</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Leader-Member Relations measure the relationships between the team members and leader</li>
  <li>Leader's Position Power ranks a Strong or Weak leader from their relative power in the entire organization</li>
  <li>Task Structure is Unstructured or Structured from how detailed and clear each member's expectations are</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Hersey-Blanchard's Situational Leadership Theory</h4>
  <p>Asserts that a leader should vary their approach from skills, knowledge, and circumstances of group members<br />Telling Style (low relationship, high task)</p>
  <ul>
  <li>The most direct form of leadership where the leader tells them what to do and how they want it done</li>
  <li>The leader and team members work very little together</li>
  <li>Works best with Maturity Level 1 (M1): least experienced, needs a leader to tell them how to do almost everything, could be from low knowledge or background</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Selling Style (high relationship, high task)</p>
  <ul>
  <li>More room for collaboration than telling</li>
  <li>Leader more frequently engages with team members and convinces them to follow specific methods</li>
  <li>Works best with Maturity Level 2 (M2): slightly more knowledge and skill than M1s, more willing to take on tasks even if they need help to do it correctly</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Participant Style (high relationship, low task)</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Leader builds relationships with team members</li>
  <li>Leader blends in more fully with followers and might even defer some decisions</li>
  <li>Works best with Maturity Level 3 (M3): excited to work on the job, has most of the skills to perform it, can do most of the work alone</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Delegating Style (low relationship, low task)</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Leader passes on most responsibilities for a project or task to team members</li>
  <li>Leaders with experienced teams will rarely need to direct members</li>
  <li>Works best with Maturity Level 4 (M4): fully able to perform a task without a leader</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Tannenbaum-Schmidt Leadership Continuum</h4>
  <p>Interprets multiple spectrums from leadership style extremes</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Every leader will fit into the middle somewhere</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The spectrum runs between Manager-Oriented Leadership (a dictator) to Team-Oriented Leadership (encourages sharing ideas)</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Tells - gives direct instructions with limited interaction, usually from distrust</li>
  <li>Sells - still direct, but allows dynamic between the leader and members where the leader still commands but listens</li>
  <li>Suggests - softer approach than selling and wants the team's input in the process</li>
  <li>Consults - trusts team members to ask their advice, gives legitimate power to the members</li>
  <li>Joins - the leader is more a member than a dictator, maintains control over choices but makes the decisions with the team</li>
  <li>Delegates - believes in the team implicitly and expects them to perform</li>
  <li>Abdicates - leader gives up any involvement and lets the team run itself from start to finish</li>
  </ol>
  <h4>Lewin's Leadership Styles Framework</h4>
  <p>Indicates three distinctive leadership styles within each person<br />A. Authoritarian Leadership takes command and doesn't pass on any decision-making responsibility<br />B. Participative Leadership works as part of a team and expects group input<br />C. Delegative Leadership hands off responsibilities entirely to team members and trusts them completely</p>
  <h4>Path-Goal Theory</h4>
  <p>Proposes all goals have a pathway and a leader is responsible for guiding the way through it</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Clears the path by helping team members see the goal, or mid-points if the end isn't in sight</li>
  <li>Removes future obstacles to the project and steps in to correct problems which inevitably arise</li>
  <li>Offers rewards to keep team members motivated and happy</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The Path-Goal theory uses and mixes four leadership types</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Supporting Leadership - leader builds relationships and shows individual interest with each member</li>
  <li>Directive Leadership - gives assignments and objectives</li>
  <li>Participative Leadership - leader motivates team members by treating them as equals in authority</li>
  <li>Achievement-Oriented Leadership - leader offers incentives and rewards to make members feel recognized and accomplished</li>
  </ol>
