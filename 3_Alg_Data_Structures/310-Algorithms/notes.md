sorting algorithms
  bubble sort
    compare the item to the things after it until you've found the LAST thing, then repeat for all the prior
    needs ALL the iterations
  insertion sort
    compare with the thing BEFORE it and swap it with the "ordered" things
    operates at about half the time
  QuickSort
    grab a random middle point, then sort everything as "chunks" in front of and behind that "partition"
