Not Understanding Is Good

Everything in computer is an abstraction
  Implementation is what it does mechanically
  Abstraction is what it does philosophically
  All automobiles get from Point A to Point B, but they do it with different engines, sometimes different power sources or different numbers of wheels
  You don't need to know how a car works to drive it, same goes for computers
  The deeper the layers of implementation you understand, the more useful you can tweak with everything and know what you're doing
  Everything on this site is about giving abstractions without the implementations, that way you can philosophically grasp all of it
