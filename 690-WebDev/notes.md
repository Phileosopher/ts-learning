Here's what I learned from Neil Patel's SEO course.
  11 1-liners to Improve SEO:
  1. Add your domain to Google's Search Console (how to)
  2. Generate a xml site map & submit it to Google Search Console (how to)
    I use Webflow, they generate it for me.
  3. Add SSL cert
    Https versus http
    Done through web host or site builder
  4. Compress images before adding to your site (free compressor)
  5. Use alt tags to describe images
  6. Link your pages to each other internally
    Makes it easier for search engines to crawl your site
    ~3-4 internal links/1500 words is solid
  7. In general, shorter URLs are better
  8. Don't put dates in URLs
  9. Use max of 2 folders in URLs
    Aka 2 backslashes
    rickcarabba.com/projects/learnspanish is 2 folders.
  10. Set Open Graph image, title, & description
    This is what's shown on social/sms when someone shares your pages
    Set through your site builder (webflow, wordpress, ghost, wix, etc.)
  11. Set title tag & meta description
    What's shown on search engines when someone looks up your pages
    Set through your site builder (webflow, wordpress, ghost, wix, etc.)
    Make title tag aligned with your H1 on the page
Figure out keyframes
  #rect {
  animation-name: rainbow;
  animation-duration: 4s;
  }
  @keyframes rainbow {
  0% {
  background-color: blue;}
  50% {
  background-color: green;}
  100% {
  background-color: yellow; }
  }
  Cycles through colors or movements
