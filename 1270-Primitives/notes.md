The more primitive, the faster, since it's more simple/elegant
But, primitives in computers are annoyingly unintuitive without training
  base-2 instead of base-10
  feeling-less reasoning (will need to convince tech ppl that they DO use their feelings)
  purpose-less thinking, compared to our way of thinking
we CAN create something that'll do lots of work to accomplish a simple task, but it's better to use a simpler method if we want to save a LOT of time
cleaning up code is the essence of this, but it's also the desired product of a veteran reviewing rookie code
