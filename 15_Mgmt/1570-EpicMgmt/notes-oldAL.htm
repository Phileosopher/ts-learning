    <ul><li>Avoid spreading any gossip or lies</li><li>Don't mix your dysfunctions with theirs</li></ul>

Number of interactions in a group:   n(n-1)/2    n = number of people in group
Brainstorming techniques
  Throw as random ideas as possible at the wall
  Everyone silently throws ideas in, then Round 2 with more ideas, then everyone votes with humming
<h3>Use the right technology, supplies, and atmosphere</h3>
Avoid an open-office environment
<ul>
  <li>While open-office environments are convenient for managers, they stifle the ability to focus solely on one task for a long time</li>
  <li>Contrary to popular opinion, open-office setups force people to retreat into mobile devices and headphones through feeling an invasion of privacy</li>
  <li>The open-plan office has been proven repeatedly as a cause of stress, conflict and employee turnover</li>
</ul>
Maintain proper equipment and supplies for your members
<ul>
  <li>Take their suggestions for supplies, but consider the budget when making decisions</li>
  <li>Bureaucracy about minor items often builds a culture of distrust</li>
</ul>
Make sure everyone is using the correct software and tools for the team's needs
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.box.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Box</span></a>, <a href="http://basecamp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Basecamp</span></a>, <a href="http://www.huddle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Huddle</span></a>, <a href="http://jive.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jive</span></a>, <a href="http://slack.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slack</span></a> or <a href="http://www.socialtext.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Socialtext</span></a></li>
</ul>
Make logging in simple for everyone by using one account for everything
Let the workers choose their computer upgrades
<ul>
  <li>Technology always costs money, so when managers determine upgrades they may go unused</li>
</ul>
Prevent IT disasters
<ul>
  <li>Avoid laptop theft with <a href="http://www.mylaptopgps.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MyLaptopGPS</span></a> or <a href="http://www.lojack.com/Laptops" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LoJack for Laptops</span></a></li>
  <li>Use cloud storage and backup to prevent data loss from hard drive failures</li>
  <li>Teach everyone <a href="http://philosaccounting.com/a/computers-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">safe computer use</span></a></li>
  <li>Install antivirus software on every computer to avoid a network virus</li>
  <li>Stop in-house technological sabotage
<ul>
  <li>Passwords do matter</li>
  <li>Separate IT roles and responsibilities to prevent one person with all the power</li>
  <li>Require the IT department to monitor actively for logic bombs</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Don't drop too much on new team members</h3>
The new experiences mixed with high expectations will create <a href="http://philosaccounting.com/a/success-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discouragements to their success</span></a>
Invest into each new member while training
<ul>
  <li>After you've thoroughly trained them, pay them to quit to avoid bringing on disloyal members</li>
</ul>
<h3>Contrary to popular opinion, team involvement and great work are unrelated</h3>
Each person's contributions make the team's efforts, not how well they get along
If someone does a task well and receives recognition, they will have no issue with a conflicted team
Members don't always need access to a larger team and more resources to succeed
New teams often do worse than old teams because the people <a href="http://philosaccounting.com/a/level-3-creating-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">haven't formed into a performing unit yet</a></span>
<h3>Make large objectives, then small ones</h3>
Make specific tasks and <a href="http://philosaccounting.com/a/how-to-be-productive-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">goals</span></a> for each future period
<ul>
  <li>Annual objectives pursue big-picture large-scale things</li>
  <li>Quarterly objectives break out the other three quarters of the coming year</li>
  <li>Monthly objectives and weekly objectives focus on the immediate quarterly result</li>
</ul>
Set out metrics (measurable numbers) to track each objective
As time passes, make new short-term objectives and adjust the long-term ones
Write out each of the goals as a 250-word paragraph
<ul>
  <li>Specify the result and timing for delivery</li>
</ul>
Compile a summary of objectives the group achieved every quarter
<ul>
  <li>Write a paragraph for each quarterly objective articulating if you completed it and anything the organization learned</li>
  <li>Include metrics on where the company struggled or thrived</li>
  <li>Describe how events occurred as well as what the company could have done better</li>
</ul>
An annual report can easily be a combination of the four quarterly summaries
<ul>
  <li>Annual reports are necessary for the company's history and future planning</li>
  <li>The outline of an annual report is the past year's objectives</li>
</ul>
<h3>Communicate clearly and directly</h3>
Most professional communication is through meetings or written updates
Communication ensures a few things
<ul>
  <li>Team members align with group goals</li>
  <li>Each person is accountable for their responsibilities</li>
  <li>Everyone is transparent about their progress</li>
</ul>
Whether it's an email brief, letter, memo, or text, management will test your communication skills
<ul>
  <li>Always respond to every communication</li>
</ul>
Meet with each member one-on-one, ideally once a week
<ul>
  <li>Ask for them to bring an agenda for discussion</li>
  <li>Take notes for follow-up action items and commitments</li>
  <li>Avoid discussing specific tasks and focus on their personal growth</li>
  <li>Acknowledge each improvement from a previous weekly update</li>
  <li>Give opportunities for them to face their fears on their own</li>
</ul>
Great managers instruct quickly and clearly
<ul>
  <li>Start with what they need to do, then explain it</li>
  <li>Point your finger to precisely indicate what you're referring to</li>
  <li>Never debate for longer than you need and give orders to clarify the boundaries</li>
</ul>
Always specify what you want
<ul>
  <li>Give specific goals</li>
  <li>Read and re-read each goal to ensure you both understand fully</li>
  <li>Let them know how and when you'll follow-up with them</li>
</ul>
Remember what you told them in the past
<ul>
  <li>Many bad managers give conflicting instructions and misunderstand the worker trying to do both things</li>
  <li>Invalidate any previous commands you may have provided</li>
</ul>
Ask them to repeat the task if you have any doubt they heard you
<ul>
  <li>People are often distracted when you speak to them and will mishear part of a command</li>
  <li>Repetition seems redundant but is critical to ensure both people see the same idea</li>
</ul>
Avoid formal performance reviews if you can
<ul>
  <li>Standardized performance reviews don't work, but they can potentially discourage members</li>
  <li>If you <em>do</em> need performance reviews, only cover information you've already covered with them in the past</li>
</ul>
<h3>Run meetings like a science</h3>
A meeting uses everyone's time
<ul>
  <li>Add up every member's hourly wage together to determine the meeting's cost</li>
</ul>
Your needs will vary, but most successful meetings are as short as possible
<ul>
  <li>Never let a meeting devolve into status updates</li>
  <li>Every meeting should focus on members' concerns</li>
</ul>
Outline all plans in writing to ensure clear follow-up communication
<ul>
  <li>You can't prove anything happened if it's not in writing</li>
  <li>Written clarification holds people accountable and protects everyone</li>
</ul>
Use an alternate communication method if you can cut a meeting down to fifteen minutes
<ul>
  <li>Send written communication for anything that doesn't have to be in a meeting</li>
  <li>Streamline or modernize meetings with <a href="http://jell.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jell</span></a>, <a href="http://getsolid.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solid</span></a> or <a href="http://stormboard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stormboard</span></a></li>
</ul>
<h4>Meetings come in two broad forms</h4>
A. Update meetings involve everyone sharing progress on a task or objective
<ul>
  <li>Avoid update meetings if you can, since you can accomplish them with written communication</li>
</ul>
B. Status meetings discuss solutions and come to an agreement
<ul>
  <li>Sharing information to a group where everyone else can ask questions</li>
  <li>Get information from a group about ideas, thoughts or expectations</li>
  <li>Answer questions anyone may have</li>

</ul>
<h4>Not everyone should be at each meeting</h4>

  <li>How the team is performing and any significant necessary changes</li>
  <li>The financial position of the company and review of metrics</li>

</ul>
Schedule executives every month for several hours to form strategies on large-scale issues

<ul>
  <li>Review past performance</li>
  <li>Connect quarterly progress with yearly goals</li>
</ul>
Meet with all leaders for a few days at the end of the year outside the office
<ul>
  <li>Reflect on the year's successes and failures</li>
  <li>Identify the coming year's most important priorities</li>
  <li>Define goals for the next year</li>
</ul>
<h4>Thoroughly prepare for the meeting</h4>
A. Define the purpose of the meeting
B. Determine who needs to attend and why
<ul>
  <li>Make sure everyone knows the meeting's purpose before attending it</li>
</ul>
C. Structure the meeting for your purpose
<ul>
  <li>If necessary, use Robert's Rules to pace the meeting and capture any communications</li>
  <li>Decide and enforce how you'll keep an informal meeting focused</li>
</ul>
D. Set the location and time of the meeting
<ul>
  <li>People with late-night lifestyles won't perform in morning meetings</li>
  <li>Provide lunch at afternoon meetings or set them after lunchtime</li>
  <li>Everyone wants to leave in the evening, which makes them unproductive</li>
  <li>Match the location to the setting you want for the meeting</li>
  <li>Set the time at an odd time, like 5 minutes after the hour, to accommodate latecomers</li>
  <li>Prevent needless distraction with a standing meeting</li>
</ul>
E. Display an agenda for everyone before the meeting starts
<ul>
  <li>Post the agenda and documents at least 24 hours before the meeting and clarify that everyone must read the materials before attending</li>
  <li>Clarify all responsibilities during the meeting
<ul>
  <li>One person will direct the meeting</li>
  <li>Someone who understands the meeting's purpose will take notes during the meeting</li>
</ul>
</li>
  <li>Only specify up to three agenda items</li>
  <li>Use the Rule of Five for each member
<ul>
  <li>Discuss two current tasks</li>
  <li>Discuss two future tasks</li>

</ul>
</li>
  <li>Make a schedule which accommodates others

  <li>Specify ground rules for the meeting about permissible discussion topics</li>
</ul>
</li>
  <li>The most effective hour-long meetings don't use conventional presentations
<ul>
  <li>A 6-page typed evidence-based narrative guides information meetings</li>
  <li>Successful meetings asking for input provide all information beforehand and skip any presentations
<ul>
  <li>An excellent non-presentation meeting with a shared vision can be over in as little as 20-30 minutes</li>
</ul>
</li>
  <li>Make meetings 15-20 minutes or two hours, but avoid a one-hour discussion</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
F. Confirm who is going or not going to the meeting and make backup plans for non-attenders
<h4>Keep the meeting on-track</h4>
Bring snacks or food to give energy and focus the team's thinking
Start on time and don't stop the meeting to explain to anyone who arrives late
<ul>
  <li>Keep to the meeting's schedule</li>
</ul>
Only discuss topics on the agenda
<ul>
  <li>Make a list of other thoughts for a different meeting</li>
</ul>
Run meetings openly
<ul>
  <li>Be vulnerable and emotionally present during the meeting
<ul>
  <li>Find similarities between yourself and them and share mutual difficulties</li>
</ul>
</li>
  <li>Team dysfunction will often stop open dialogue or permit dominant personalities to overpower the meeting</li>
  <li>Foster healthy discussion about other options</li>
</ul>
Clarify the next actions to take
<ul>
  <li>If the group must agree, count a vote ranked for each option</li>
  <li>Specify deadline dates, times or expectations for tasks</li>
  <li>Openly talk about risks connected to tasks</li>
  <li>Clarify who will do what</li>
</ul>
<h4>Follow-up the meeting</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Distribute all notes to everyone</li>
  <li>Track anything promised during the meeting</li>
  <li>Take future meetings off the calendar or change its format if it seems unnecessary</li>
</ul>
<h4>Try the Stepladder Technique to generate new ideas</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Give the task or problem to all the members
<ul>
  <li>Ask them to think of a good solution to the problem</li>
  <li>Give them plenty of time to find opinions for a suitable answer</li>
</ul>
</li>
  <li>Create a core group of two members to discuss the problem</li>
  <li>Add a third member to the core group
<ul>
  <li>That third member shares their ideas <em>before</em> hearing the other two members' thoughts</li>
  <li>Discuss the options together after all three have shared their ideas</li>
</ul>
</li>
  <li>Repeat the third with each new member until you've involved all members</li>
  <li>Reach a final decision after everyone has presented their ideas</li>
</ol>
<h3>Each person has a different set of motivations</h3>
Motivations vary even with the same goals
Money is always a great incentive, especially against peers' income, but it can't be the only one
<ul>
  <li>Balance their work between achievement and challenge where they both feel they've succeeded and see more room to grow</li>
  <li>They are most motivated when their boss both works harder than them and cares about their success</li>
  <li>Great workers never feel paid enough to work for bad managers</li>
</ul>
Since motivations depend on personality, some are opposite each other
<ul>
  <li>Working conditions
<ul>
  <li>The work itself</li>
  <li>Social recognition for completing tasks</li>
  <li>The social experience of making detailed shared action plans</li>
  <li>Exclusive control or responsibility of a project or task</li>
  <li>Defined structure and organization for systems or methods</li>
  <li>A lack of structure to give freedom to explore alternate methods for tasks</li>
  <li>Permission to fail while trying to succeed</li>
  <li>Mixing pleasure and fun with business</li>
  <li>Non-cash benefits</li>
  <li>Free time to think and explore other projects</li>
</ul>
</li>
  <li>Short-term goals
<ul>
  <li>Completion of a project</li>
  <li>Listing clear and tangible project outcomes</li>
</ul>
</li>
  <li>Long-term opportunities
<ul>
  <li>Opportunities for advancement or promotion</li>
  <li>Opportunities to learn and grow
<ul>
  <li>Fill the organization's library with multiple copies of business and self-help books, then encourage them to take whatever they want</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
  <li>Purpose and meaning for their work
<ul>
  <li>A meaningful way the task will improve someone's life</li>
  <li>Opportunities for creative expression or spontaneity</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Some things always discourage workers
<ul>
  <li>Stifling policies or needless bureaucracy</li>
  <li>Over-involved supervision</li>
  <li>Unhealthy relationships with supervisor or peers</li>
  <li>Unsafe or uncomfortable working environment</li>
  <li>Salary or benefits feel inadequate</li>
  <li>Little to no social status from the work</li>
  <li>Little to no job security</li>
  <li>Unclear direction about the project's direction</li>
  <li>Very little confidence in personal ability</li>
</ul>
Ask directly to discover what they want
<ul>
  <li>Everyone has different tastes they don't always express</li>
  <li>Follow-up on any ideas they provide or they may hate you for listening without acting</li>
</ul>
<h3>Management is coaching</h3>
The term "human resources" imply managing people like supplies, but people have individual lives and personalities
<ul>
  <li>Learn the difference between coachable development needs versus major unchangeable flaws</li>
  <li>Only direct their tasks, not for members to change something they can't</li>
</ul>
Good managers understand their value comes from their team
<ul>
  <li>Managers receive all the work, and it's their duty and honor to give to the members</li>
  <li>A good manager's relationship with the rest of the team must build on trust and honesty</li>
  <li>The manager is the members' servant, but it's the manager's responsibility to show it</li>
</ul>
Advise the team with the technical skills that brought you into management
Most members grow quietly disconnected to their managers if they don't feel the manager coaches well enough
<ul>
  <li>Communicates strategy and values vaguely or shows conflicted priorities</li>
  <li>The senior team is ineffective at their core tasks</li>
  <li>Leader's style is too controlling or relaxed</li>
  <li>Doesn't inspire peers to communicate with each other</li>
  <li>Poor leadership or management skills</li>
  <li>Little to no communication between manager and the rest of the team</li>
</ul>
<h3>Continually improve the team's positive culture</h3>
Stay optimistic, <a href="http://philosaccounting.com/a/how-to-be-happy-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">happy</span></a>, confident and energetic
<ul>
  <li>Be someone others want to follow</li>
  <li>Positive and confident leaders make happier workers</li>
  <li>Happy workers are more productive and please customers more</li>
</ul>
A great manager comfortably adapts to volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous changes
You don't have to be fearless, but you do need to look fearless
<ul>
  <li>Make decisions with a decisive attitude</li>
  <li>Learn how to <a href="http://philosaccounting.com/a/handling-conflicts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">manage conflicts and negotiate</span></a></li>
  <li>Take full responsibility for whatever happens</li>
  <li>Behave as if what you're familiar with whatever you're experiencing</li>
</ul>
Stay perpetually available emotionally to slowly win others' trust
<ul>
  <li>Leaders must inspire thought to build a reputation with members</li>
  <li>A new leader will fail and is responsible for accepting that failure, learning from it, and moving on</li>
  <li>Make a digital suggestion box where they can anonymously send you messages about ideas</li>
</ul>
Look at a work environment as a team of people
<ul>
  <li>A small group is a team, not an organization or a structured system</li>
  <li>The group is more a community than a machine</li>
  <li>A larger organization is an ecosystem, not a battleground</li>
</ul>
Show your human side to demonstrate everyone is in a shared win/lose situation
<ul>
  <li>Expressing humanity is more difficult than it sounds because you can't fake it
<ul>
  <li>Managers must identify with members' feelings and defects of character</li>
</ul>
</li>
  <li>Fully express a variety of appropriate emotions to your team, especially anger and joy
<ul>
  <li>However, don't let any negative feelings linger for long</li>
</ul>
</li>
  <li>Always direct positive feelings like joy and happiness toward the person and not only the action
<ul>
  <li>Though it's often challenging, sharing open happiness always pays off</li>
</ul>
</li>
  <li>Target negative feelings like anger to actions and never people
<ul>
  <li>Anger focuses others on the source of the anger</li>
  <li>Anger generates confidence in others from the rush of adrenaline</li>
  <li>Channel any anxiety or fear into that anger</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
As vulnerable as you must show yourself, never lead with your emotions
<ul>
  <li>Instincts and gut feelings have their place, but analytical members will distrust you</li>
  <li>Act in the best interests of yourself and the organization, since one member can sabotage the entire group</li>
  <li>Living a principled life will naturally work against leading with feelings</li>
</ul>
Competition among members can be beneficial, but too much will destroy relationships
<ul>
  <li>By its very nature, competition creates distrust and insecurity</li>
  <li>Never compare a member's performance to others, only to their past self</li>
</ul>
<h3>Give consistent advice and constant recognition</h3>
In general, give praise in public and criticize in private
Never mix constructive feedback into praise
<ul>
  <li>Any criticism invalidates the praise you just gave</li>
  <li>Save your criticism for later</li>
</ul>
People need recognition to feel valued
<ul>
  <li>Workers perform better when they know someone cares about their work</li>
  <li>The right recognition to the right people inspire a challenge to the rest of the team</li>
</ul>
Workers naturally sense when others value them or when they're disposable
<ul>
  <li>Younger workers need a role model to aspire to and more opportunities to grow and advance</li>
  <li>Older workers demand respect for their skills and enough job security to retire with dignity</li>
  <li>People who feel valued are more inclined to share the organization's vision</li>
</ul>
Deliver praise as frequently as possible and intentionally set aside time for it
<ol>
  <li>Tell them right away you are letting them know how they are doing</li>
  <li>Praise them immediately, not later on</li>
  <li>Tell them what they did right, and be as specific as possible</li>
  <li>Tell them how good you feel about what they did right and how it helps both the organization and others who work there</li>
  <li>Stop for a moment of silence to let them "feel" how they did</li>
  <li>Encourage them to do more of the same</li>
  <li>Shake hands in a way that shows you support their success in the organization</li>
</ol>
<h4>Some praise is more effective than others</h4>
Only deliver genuine praise
<ul>
  <li>People know when others patronize them</li>
  <li>Avoid formal recognition programs since they're rarely genuine</li>
</ul>
Praise the effort put into an accomplishment, not the accomplishment itself
<ul>
  <li>You're trying to inspire achievement, not results at all costs</li>
  <li>Try to catch them doing something right when they don't think you're watching</li>
</ul>
Surprise them to keep them engaged
<ul>
  <li>Deliver random and unexpected praises for their performance</li>
</ul>
Cash gifts always work but aren't the only way to give rewards
<ul>
  <li>Give unexpected gifts (tailored to each person for more impact)</li>
  <li>Try celebrating instead of a reward, which is essentially recognition but more fun</li>
  <li>Dinner with them requires their mandatory personal time</li>
</ul>
If you have fixed incentives tied directly to performance (like sales commissions) avoid anything which favors underachievement
<ul>
  <li>Giving inadequate praise to higher achievers creates team dysfunction</li>
  <li>Foster healthy competition with fun and lightweight non-cash incentives
<ul>
  <li>Something people want will inspire them to sabotage each other</li>
  <li>Not everyone responds to competition with enthusiasm</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Create a culture of worker appreciation
<ul>
  <li>Inspire them to thank each other</li>
  <li>Give incentives for them to catch others doing well</li>
</ul>
<h4>Deliver criticism correctly</h4>
Warn them immediately that in no uncertain terms you're about to let them know how they are doing
Make the first half of the reprimand a clear warning
<ul>
  <li>Correct them immediately</li>
  <li>Tell them what they did wrong, and be as specific as possible</li>
  <li>Tell them how you feel about what they did wrong in a way where they can't misunderstand how you feel</li>
  <li>Stop for a few seconds of uncomfortable silence to allow your feeling to sink in</li>
</ul>
The second half of the reprimand should encourage them to do better
<ul>
  <li>Shake hands with them in a way that shows you're honestly on their side</li>
  <li>Reaffirm you think well of them even though you dislike their performance in that specific situation</li>
</ul>
Never, ever bring it up again if they improve
<h3>Help them improve their career</h3>
Give them career development resources
Share personal network connections
Give hard-to-deliver feedback if their behavior is stifling their growth or potential
<ul>
  <li>Spend more time in one-on-one meetings for them to talk out their challenges</li>
</ul>
Give them opportunities for learning experiences through failures
<h3>Give them enough time to enjoy their personal lives</h3>
Model your non-work life before giving input
Don't let them frequently work late or on weekends unless they insist
Consider adding more part-time or temporary team members if there's more work than the members can keep up with
<h3>Managing crisis is a critical part of management</h3>
Most people don't handle crisis well
The crisis can vary
<ul>
  <li>Worker <a href="http://philosaccounting.com/a/handling-conflicts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">conflicts</span></a></li>
  <li>An external problem</li>
  <li>Team member failures</li>
  <li>Your failure</li>
  <li>Another department's failure</li>
  <li>Something nobody could have predicted</li>
</ul>
<h4>Foster a culture that endures problems well</h4>
Encourage open discussion and disagreement to let the whole group see an issue
<ul>
  <li>Welcome conflicts as they arise to avoid dysfunction from not dealing with them</li>
  <li>Invite constructive criticism to hear what people think</li>
  <li>Don't merely debate, give orders after everyone has voiced their issues</li>
</ul>
Train everyone for perfection
<ul>
  <li>Have them practice tasks, then have everyone else criticize them</li>
  <li>Grade how they perform as well as what they know</li>
</ul>
Frequently review behaviors you're rewarding
<ul>
  <li>Consider whether you're showing favoritism or have a bias</li>
</ul>
Treat everyone with professional dignity
<ul>
  <li>Giving severance pay to let someone go is often worth the cost</li>
</ul>
Involve the group with the community
<ul>
  <li>Participate in as many activities and causes as possible when things are going well</li>
  <li>Communicate the organization's message to everyone through all channels</li>
  <li>Get direct customer feedback instead of hearing workers disagree with an idea</li>
</ul>
Cultivate a culture of innovation
<ul>
  <li>Fuel everyone's passions</li>
  <li>Foster autonomy in everyone</li>
  <li>Foster innovation by <a href="http://philosaccounting.com/a/level-3-creating-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">increasing the team's diversity</span></a></li>
</ul>
<h4>Crises aren't fully avoidable</h4>
Assume the problem is worse than it appears
<ul>
  <li>Over-reacting will cover unseen risks from small problems</li>
</ul>
Assume there are no secrets and everyone will hear about the issue
<ul>
  <li>People like to talk about bad news more than anything else</li>
  <li>Trying to hide a problem makes you appear to be part of the problem</li>
  <li>Assume the public will portray you in the worst possible light</li>
  <li>Society usually looks at authority figures negatively, so expect an automatic bias against you</li>
</ul>
Presume you'll need to change people and processes
<ul>
  <li>An issue will happen again if you don't act to add or remove the system's elements</li>
  <li>Sometimes a problem repeats itself because you made the wrong call
<ul>
  <li>If you made the wrong call, try to make amends to anyone you've accidentally wronged</li>
</ul>
</li>
  <li>Offer incentives instead of ultimatums when making changes</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>If you're motivated, you'll survive changes where the group will grow stronger from it</li>
</ul>
<h3>Take extra precaution with a remote workforce</h3>
Communicate more frequently to compensate for not seeing them in-person
<ul>
  <li>Connect more often with them</li>
  <li>You will usually need a daily or semi-daily meeting, especially in large teams</li>
  <li>Plan discussions ahead of time to compensate for spontaneous meetings which would have arisen in person</li>
  <li>Everyone has a separate schedule and will often work around personal life, so stay flexible</li>
</ul>
Instill a culture of trust to ensure everyone holds themselves personally accountable
It's impossible to derive a gut instinct from a video chat
<ul>
  <li>Drive performance on data instead of gut feelings</li>
  <li>Coach and lead other workers with your top performers</li>
</ul>
Look for opportunities for personal interactions
<ul>
  <li>Make fun events to honor birthdays, anniversaries, promotions, and any other special events</li>
</ul>
Meet in person routinely and set aside part of the budget for it
<ul>
  <li>Real-life engagements build connections and bonds in ways distance can't</li>
</ul>
<h3>Great managers give incentives before punishments</h3>
People only feel actions or learn from them if a leader connects them to consequences
<ul>
  <li>Allowed to learn their lessons</li>
  <li>Rewarded for their achievements</li>
  <li>Managers will look past the action into others' motivations and feelings</li>
</ul>
You can force what you want, but it creates long-term distrust and hatred
<ul>
  <li>Kindness, passion, support, and gratitude give great results by comparison</li>
  <li>Deliver orders as recommendations or as a shared need</li>
  <li>Treat others the way how you'd wish if you were in their position</li>
  <li>Good leaders believe leadership is earned, not given</li>
</ul>
<h3>Correct members when it's called for</h3>
If you must reprimand, forget about the event afterward
Leaders must make difficult decisions
<ul>
  <li>Conflicts are inevitable, and you must let most of them play out</li>
  <li>Workers become ineffective very slowly, so noticing takes plenty of <a href="http://philosaccounting.com/a/how-to-be-self-aware/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">awareness and sensitivity</span></a></li>
  <li><a href="http://philosaccounting.com/a/coexistence-104-tact-charm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tactfully and appropriately</span></a> <a href="http://philosaccounting.com/a/handling-conflicts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">punishing and dismissing</span></a> bad workers is a large portion of management success</li>
</ul>
<h4>Stay out of disagreements among members</h4>
Don't let them bring you in to mediate a problem
<ul>
  <li>It wastes everyone's time, especially yours</li>
  <li>It creates divisiveness among members from an appearance of lobbying</li>
  <li>It fosters a political culture which fights for your favor</li>
</ul>
If you must get involved, follow a few rules
<ol>
  <li>Information is free, and anyone can bring up anyone and anything</li>
  <li>Members with the conflict must try to resolve the situation with a win-win answer</li>
  <li>Only bring the problem to a manager if everyone can't reach an agreement
<ul>
  <li>They must present it as a shared narrative with possible solutions</li>
  <li>Clarify unresolved trade-offs</li>
</ul>
</li>
  <li>If the manager gives a resolution one of them dislikes, that person will resolve it without the manager</li>
  <li>That person can only take it to the manager after it's stayed unresolved</li>
  <li>If anyone doesn't agree with the situation, the manager can take forceful action</li>
</ol>
<h3>Each person loses their dedication to a group in a different way</h3>
Burned out from working too much
<ul>
  <li>Works frantically until exhaustion and then vents about it</li>
  <li>Does unrewarding tasks and cynically avoids doing the job</li>
  <li>Feels too much stress and responsibility, then loses all motivation to keep going</li>
</ul>
Decreased professionalism at work
<ul>
  <li>Doesn't respect management any more</li>
  <li>Customer service is no longer a priority</li>
  <li>Behaving as if they've already accomplished enough not to need to work anymore</li>
  <li>Gossips about others not in the room with them</li>
  <li>Takes full credit for good things and deflects everything bad to other members</li>
</ul>
Increased hostility in the work environment
<ul>
  <li>No longer doing favors like staying later or coming early</li>
  <li>Saying "that's not my job" about anything outside of the job description</li>
  <li>Treats their experience like it's a physical commodity and insults less experienced people with potentially more skills, performance or achievement</li>
  <li>Uses peer pressure to discourage more determined workers</li>
</ul>
Disengagement from the work
<ul>
  <li>Consistently calling off, not coming to work or taking days off</li>
  <li>No longer caring about their work quality or fulfilling deadlines</li>
  <li>A general sense of apathy about the work</li>
</ul>
<h4>Firing and rehiring for the position is often far more resource-intensive than providing more motivation</h4>
It costs more directly
<ul>
  <li>Extra advertising, recruitment, and training costs for new hires</li>
  <li>Firing the wrong way causes expensive legal risks</li>
  <li>Financial performance of a new worker is universally weaker</li>
</ul>
It has indirect costs
<ul>
  <li>Missed deadlines and interrupted workflow</li>
  <li>The team's reputation is damaged</li>
  <li>Decreased customer service</li>
  <li>The group shares less knowledge among each other</li>
</ul>
It's destructive to team morale
<ul>
  <li>More absences from stress</li>
  <li>Other team members start leaving from feeling unsettled</li>
  <li>Damaged relationships</li>
</ul>
There are many good reasons to fire someone without looking into it further
<ul>
  <li>Sometimes the role and the individual can't naturally match</li>
  <li>Maliciousness towards anyone else, especially subordinates</li>
  <li>An older worker who needs to retire</li>
  <li>Doesn't improve no matter how many times they are corrected or spoken to</li>
  <li>Continually disrespects and subverts the workplace culture</li>
</ul>
<h4>Bad workers come in a few varieties</h4>
Don't jump to conclusions
<ul>
  <li>Someone under-performing might have an attitude problem, but they may experience an isolated incident</li>
  <li>Several people under-performing demonstrates your failures as a manager</li>
</ul>
Incompetent and ineffective
<ul>
  <li>Often quite happy but very low performers</li>
  <li>Disorganized and passive to doing anything</li>
  <li>Resistant to any changes</li>
  <li>Drive them to work more effectively
<ul>
  <li>Use steady support</li>
  <li>Plan their improvement</li>
  <li>Give extra training</li>
  <li>Supervise more closely by tracking their performance</li>
  <li>Demand accountability from them</li>
  <li>Train them more and give more mentoring opportunities</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Lazy and uninterested
<ul>
  <li>Unmotivated to do any tasks or fulfill any deadlines</li>
  <li>More reserved and quieter</li>
  <li>No longer interested in advancing their career</li>
  <li>Keeps poor track of time on projects</li>

  <li>Consistently gone from work</li>
  <li>Inspire them to work
<ul>
  <li>Find their hidden resentments</li>
  <li>Give explicitly clear expectations</li>
  <li>Do unscheduled checks on them</li>
  <li>Increase their rewards for succeeding or give them a portion of the organization's income</li>
  <li>Give them unique assignments to expand their scope of responsibility</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Selfishly overworking
<ul>
  <li>Refuses to hand off projects to others</li>
  <li>Unaware of personal limits</li>
  <li>Undermines confidence of other members</li>
  <li>Inspire them to be more of a team player
<ul>
  <li>Force them to delegate projects</li>
  <li>Reward their ability to work in a team</li>
  <li>Give them more time to relax and encourage paid time off</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Socially engages more than works
<ul>
  <li>Distracting and loud to the rest of the team</li>
  <li>Unfocused and uninterested in the work</li>
  <li>Immature and unprofessional to the point of causing a social backlash</li>
  <li>Help them focus more
<ul>
  <li>Consistently redirect them back to the project</li>
  <li>Clarify what others expect from their behavior</li>
  <li>Use their interpersonal energy and skills</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

  <li>Manipulates and sabotages relationships</li>
  <li>Provide clear boundaries
<ul>

  <li>Take complaints about them seriously</li>
  <li>Carefully document unhealthy behaviors and look for likely motivations</li>
  <li>Trust your instincts about them</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Try to motivate them more before considering firing</h4>
Keeping a terrible worker is far more expensive than finding a new one
Most people feel uncomfortable asking for a pay raise, and it may be overdue
<h3>Fire workers correctly</h3>
Sometimes you will have to lay off workers
<ul>
  <li>Procrastinating layoffs make the process harder since your relationship with them usually improves over time</li>
  <li>Allow more time for future growth and healing by laying off everyone all at once instead of a few smaller ones</li>
</ul>
Keep employee turnover costs in mind
<ul>
  <li>Losing an employee can cost from $10,000 to 1.5-2 times the employee's annual salary</li>
  <li>Turnover costs come from bringing the worker to peak capacity
<ol>
  <li>Hiring costs including lost time interviewing and sifting through resumes</li>
  <li>Training and HR costs</li>
  <li>Costs of the new hire learning the job role's intricacies</li>
  <li>Costs of time with an unfilled role</li>
</ol>
</li>
  <li>Calculate team turnover costs
<ul>
  <li>Associated Costs x Turnover Percentage x Number of Workers</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Make firing go smoothly</h4>
Manage their transition out of the group
Fire with complete certainty, and manage the process intentionally
<ul>
  <li>Firing should be the last action of a long process</li>
</ul>
Own up to it unapologetically
<ul>
  <li>They don't care how much it hurts you</li>
  <li>They should know why they're getting fired</li>
  <li>Say "I'm sorry, but I have to let you go" without any further apology or explanation</li>
  <li>If they try to argue, don't make it a back-and-forth conflict</li>
  <li>Don't ask if you can do anything for them since they will want you to give them the job back</li>
  <li>If they were laid off, do everything you can to connect them with work elsewhere</li>
</ul>
Have a witness during the conversation to ensure they don't make false claims over what you said
<ul>
  <li>Even if it seems patronizing, it's necessary</li>
  <li>At the same time, don't do anything condescending like escorting them to the door that that makes them look like a criminal</li>
</ul>
<h4>After you've fired anyone, learn from your mistakes</h4>
You will make hiring mistakes, so own them and move on
Improve your interviewing process
<ul>
  <li>Use personality tests more and pull from your network more frequently for leads</li>
  <li>Look for motivations when hiring, not skills</li>
  <li>Use job descriptions with more requirements for performance and less for skills</li>
  <li>Focus on better quality candidates instead of more of them</li>
</ul>
Look at your organization's culture more closely
<ul>
  <li>Try to improve it for future candidates</li>
</ul>
Make your relationship with future candidates better than the terminated worker
Don't pay a salary premium to compensate for an unhappy work culture
When marketing the job, focus on growth, impact, and care
<ul>
  <li>Growth is essential for everyone, but more for younger workers</li>
  <li>The work's impact is also critical for younger workers but matters to everyone</li>
  <li>Care is vital for everyone, but older workers are far more sensitive to neglect</li>
</ul>
<h3>A worker who quits leaves management, not an organization</h3>
They will leave for many reasons
<ul>
  <li>They feel disrespected or not listened to</li>
  <li>They see others given preferential treatment
<ul>
  <li>They had work taken from them and given to other workers</li>
  <li>Peers receive opportunities they're not allowed to attain</li>
  <li>Someone else took credit for their accomplishments or ideas</li>
</ul>
</li>
  <li>They don't see opportunities for growth or professional development
<ul>
  <li>The job isn't what they expected</li>
  <li>They feel a mismatch between the position and the person</li>
  <li>They don't feel they received enough feedback or coaching</li>
  <li>Little to no recognition for their work</li>
  <li>They don't feel they're paid enough or have inadequate benefits</li>
</ul>
</li>
  <li>They feel their values no longer coincide with their leaders' values
<ul>
  <li>Management is exercising morally questionable or <a href="http://philosaccounting.com/a/level-1-being-a-professional/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unprofessional</span></a> practices</li>
  <li>They've lost trust or confidence in senior leaders</li>
  <li>The organization is confusing and uninspiring or poorly managed</li>
  <li>Too much work or a work-life imbalance causing stress in their personal life</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Have an exit interview to find out why they are leaving and what would inspire them to stay
If they choose to stay from a counter-offer, keeping them in the long-term is challenging
<ul>
  <li>They might disrupt the rest of the team from a feeling of inequity</li>
  <li>Gracefully let them go and maintain a good relationship to open up a possible future recruitment</li>
</ul>
Management 3 - Legacy 14
  <h3>Level 4 leadership is excellent Level 3 leadership over time</h3>
  <p>Level 4 leaders create other leaders, which comes from a healthy group culture</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Cultures take time to develop</li>
  <li>A strong culture doesn't need anyone to enforce rules because everyone wants to succeed together</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Level 4 leaders work beyond management into creating a better environment to work in</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Keeps everyone focused on the group's overall vision</li>
  <li>Fights against bureaucracy's inevitable crawl by making every system as straightforward as possible</li>
  <li>Talks less about various work-related matters with the entire group as people specialize in specific roles</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Healthy groups share some common traits across all cultures</h3>
  <p>Honest and transparent</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Use email systems where everyone can search all other members' emails</li>
  <li>Workers are allowed to access all information</li>
  <li>Members can easily make one-on-one meetings with managers, maybe even with designated weekly office hours</li>
  <li>Every idea is measured on the concept alone, not on who said it</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Creating new answers as a thorough process</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Require every new idea written in a document with a minimum length, not just email or meetings</li>
  <li>Cross-pollinate ideas by mixing everyone across various workgroups and departments</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Subordinates can freely use preferred methods when they produce results</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Flexible hours if the work isn't time-sensitive or requires their physical presence</li>
  <li>Trusting attitude that someone will do all assigned work without further incentive</li>
  <li>Dress codes which permit semi-casual or casual clothing</li>
  <li>Mandatory non-email weekend days or evenings to force them towards personal time</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Everyone is allowed to be human and make occasional mistakes</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Managers avoid micro-managing or forcing members' dependence on them</li>
  <li>Everyone's work is reviewed by peers to improve quality and trust</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Each member is free to do what they want if the job gets done</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Permission to use social media through their work computer</li>
  <li>Allowed to use personal phones at work</li>
  <li>Permission to bring their toys or comfort items into the office</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Openness in the culture to new things</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Embraces diversity and originality</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Nobody is over-worked</p>
  <ul>
  <li>The brain can only concentrate for thirteen hours after waking up, then creates equivalent results as drunkenness would</li>
  <li>Efficiency is more important than perseverance</li>
  <li>Long workdays have many hidden costs
  <ul>
  <li>Decreased productivity</li>
  <li>Increased overtime costs</li>
  <li>Relationship tension within the team</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Pushing exhausted workers harder from lost income creates a vicious cycle by making them work even less productively</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Improving a dysfunctional team takes time</h3>
  <p>The limits to how well change can benefit a group come from its leadership</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Bold new ventures inspire teams to the level its leaders believe in it</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Systems usually show clear signs of bureaucracy</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Written in abstract or hard-to-understand phrasing</li>
  <li>Expectations are unrealistic, hard to measure or vague</li>
  <li>Processes described have a slow response time</li>
  <li>Anything unintuitive or illogical</li>
  <li>Any obsolete information</li>
  <li>Readers feel insulted by its wording or hate going through it</li>
  <li>Differing levels of achievement give the same rewards</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you want to rebuild a team, do it slowly</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Give everyone clear and reasonable goals which align with the organization's vision</li>
  <li>Analyze the organization's structure for any gaps in processes</li>
  <li>Make a strategy to manage the organization's weaknesses and shortcomings</li>
  <li>Have everyone carry out the plan, usually across weeks or months</li>
  <li>Monitored and evaluate how well everyone is adopting the changes with a performance management system</li>
  </ol>
  <h4>Don't make success a direct incentive</h4>
  <p>Goodhart's Law: a measurement that becomes a target is no longer a good measurement</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Use multiple metrics if you're only using one</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A focus on achieving inspires people to manipulate the system to get ahead</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Sales or budget goals inspire gaming the measured numbers</li>
  <li>Measuring amount of time on tasks encourages quick and ugly solutions or poor service</li>
  <li>Measuring customer happiness inspires inefficient people-pleasing methods</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Goodhart's Law has an answer, however</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Cut out incentives entirely</li>
  <li>Pay a going rate</li>
  <li><a href="http://philosaccounting.com/a/level-3-creating-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hire the correct people</a></span></li>
  <li>Tell them to work to the best of their ability</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Level 4 leaders inspire their members to become leaders</h3>
  <p>The followers will want to imitate their leader</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Successfully become an excellent <a href="http://philosaccounting.com/a/level-1-being-a-professional/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Level 1</span></a>, <a href="http://philosaccounting.com/a/level-2-working-with-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Level 2</span></a>, and <a href="http://philosaccounting.com/a/level-3-creating-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Level 3</span></a> leader</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Look for new challenging assignments for yourself and never stop growing</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Lead a volunteer organization, a group of freelancers or find other leadership opportunities</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Find ways to improve yourself and keep raising standards for yourself</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Grow in every possible <a href="http://philosaccounting.com/a/success/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">personal achievement</a></span></li>
  <li>Write down a "personal leadership code" of 5-10 points you always live by</li>
  <li>As you start traveling more, <a href="http://philosaccounting.com/a/how-to-get-to-the-right-weight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">work out away from home</span></a></li>
  <li>Find new projects and endeavors, even in recreation</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Leaders are fostered and mentored by more powerful leaders over time</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Training a leader needs constant and dedicated input, feedback, encouragement, and guidance</li>
  <li>Great leaders consistently apply great leadership principles across years</li>
  <li>If you're a leader, you're training others every day
  <ul>
  <li>Your leadership goes beyond your work and into your family and friends</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Never sacrifice your personal life for work</h4>
  <p>Instead, give away more responsibilities than you might be comfortable with</p>
  <ul>
  <li>The larger your group grows, the more you'll need to delegate</li>
  <li>Change up management structure to a more free-form one</li>
  <li>Empower workers to train each other
  <ul>
  <li>Train and educate them on how to make the organization succeed</li>
  <li>Make "subject matter experts" to share their understanding with the rest of the group</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Let the producers and labor solve the toughest problems
  <ul>
  <li>They're usually more trustworthy to resolve them than you because they're more familiar with them</li>
  <li>Give young workers structure to channel their energy, engagement, and desire toward problems</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Build a stronger business by taking time away from it</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Learn to live away from your phone occasionally</li>

    <ul><li>Only a <a href="http://philosaccounting.com/a/coexistence-104-tact-charm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">charismatic</a>, smart, and socially intelligent leader can carry that vision</li><li>They naturally foster trust to build great relationships and teams</li></ul>

    <ul><li>Looks ahead at obstacles to success and removes them as fast as possible</li><li>Always wants a little more than the current status</li><li>Routinely looks at the organization's financial condition and realistically estimates costs for to the budget</li></ul>
  <h3>Organizations only succeed with a well-communicated vision</h3>
    <p>Excellent communication isn't necessarily great leadership</p>
    <ul><li>People follow a strong leader, not just great ideas</li><li><a href="http://philosaccounting.com/a/success/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assess yourself</a> to become someone people want to follow</li></ul>
    <p>The message must bring a passion for serving a higher purpose beyond self-interest</p>
    <ul><li>Procedures and tasks change with culture and situation, but a vision won't move</li><li>The purpose must form into something to specifically help someone</li><li>The more straightforward and focused the message is, the farther and quicker it will travel</li><li>The vision will carry itself far beyond the individual and into future generations when expressed correctly</li></ul>
    <p>Members of the organization should have more than enough training to succeed at working toward the vision<br>Everyone in the organization must be devoted wholly to the organization's vision</p>
    <ul><li>The organization's principles should require members to adapt or leave</li><li>Members must feel their input contributes to the collective vision</li></ul>

  <h3>Socially engineer your organization</h3>
    <p>Set rules that support or discourage certain large-scale behaviors</p>
    <h4>Most organizations correct their course with two methods</h4>
    <p>A. Placing many rules to follow precisely to avoid mistakes</p>
    <ul><li>People usually find ways to honor rules while still doing a terrible job</li><li>Formalized systems often make potentially devoted members disloyal from a lack of distinguishing other positive qualities (e.g., reprimand for a late delivery without considering the circumstances)</li></ul>
    <p>B. Giving incentives to make people want great results</p>
    <ul><li>People usually find ways to game the system and invalidate the incentive's purpose</li><li>Over time, the focus can become distorted into a completely arbitrary set of rules which don't produce results</li><li>If you decide not to have incentives, make sure everyone knows precisely why</li></ul>
    <p>The only long-term cure for lousy performance is a virtue-based culture</p>
    <ul><li>Practical wisdom is both the moral skill to learn what the right thing is and the moral will to do it</li><li>Wise people know particular instances for when and how the rules don't apply</li></ul>
    <h4>Not everyone likes working in a great organization</h4>
    <ul><li>They must like others' expectations that they seek accomplishment</li><li>They have to adapt to the established culture</li><li>They need to feel proud to be part of that organization</li><li>They have to take an interest in changing everything about their work</li><li>They must value clear, open, and honest communication</li></ul>
    <h4>Great members of dysfunctional cultures must do one of a few things</h4>
    <ol><li>Work twice as hard through the necessary bureaucracy to come to the important part of the work</li><li>Ignore and break completely arbitrary rules they fully know nobody checks and nobody cares about</li><li>Compromise their values and become part of the problem</li><li>Leave the system and find a better environment</li></ol>
  <h3>Many benefits can improve an organization's culture</h3>
    <h4>Increase focus on results</h4>
    <p>Give cash rewards proportional to performance</p>
    <ul><li>Communicate well in advance to avoid surprises</li><li>Start with merit raises before giving harder-to-calculate incentive bonuses</li><li>Set extremes in the system to heavily reward high performers</li><li>Make them feel the team's effort by tying a portion of the bonus pool to overall profitability</li><li>Don't compare employees to review each one fairly</li></ul>
    <p>Give a company car or a car program with insurance, maintenance, and repair<br>Give extra time off for staying on for set periods or attaining specific goals<br>Celebrate high achievers with a lavish ceremony<br>Provide nap rooms or lodging to help with massive projects<br>Negotiate discounts or free productivity and management software they can use for personal purposes</p>

  <h3>Every organization grows through a life cycle</h3>
    <p>The larger the organization grows, the less hands-on and responsive the leader's role becomes<br>Changes are always definite and clear in large organizations</p>
    <ol><li>The situation is "unfrozen" from its static format by reducing certain requirements</li><li>A social movement arises with some confusion and inefficiency as everyone adjusts to a new way of doing things
  <ul><li>These changes must come from an open system which combines internal feedback and external signals</li></ul>
  </li><li>New standards are "frozen" as everyone agrees to the new changes</li></ol>
    <p>Each organization travels through four periods</p>
    <ol><li>Formation period - a new organization started, a founding vision without formal definitions</li><li>Rapid growth period - organization adds direction and coordination to keep growing and ensuring success</li><li>Mature period - growth slows to match the pace of the industry</li><li>Declining period - often involves laying off workers and reorganizing</li><li>Successful reorganization creates a new Formation period</li></ol>
    <h4>The Greiner Curve tracks how organizations grow from leadership</h4>
    <p>NOTE: Each growth rate varies and the crises aren't always in order<br>A. Growth through creativity</p>
    <ul><li>The founders of the organization spend most of their time making products and opening markets</li><li>Not many staff and mostly informal communication</li><li>Rewards for long hours and hard work usually come through profits or company stock</li><li>Growth ends with a <em>leadership crisis</em> and the need for professional management
  <ul><li>The leader must more effectively organize the organization's resources</li></ul>
  </li></ul>
    <p>B. Growth through direction</p>
    <ul><li>Someone new usually brought in to compensate for insufficient leadership</li><li>More formal communications</li><li>More budgeting and focus on separating activities like marketing, production or sales</li><li>Incentive benefits mostly replace stock or profit as a financial reward</li><li>Growth ends with an <em>autonomy crisis</em> once the products or processes have grown so numerous one person can't manage or remember all of them
  <ul><li>The leader must start delegating responsibilities to others</li></ul>
  </li></ul>
    <p>C. Growth through delegation</p>
    <ul><li>Mid-level managers are freed up to react quickly to new market and product opportunities</li><li>Top management monitors and manages large-scale issues like mergers and acquisition opportunities</li><li>Most organizations fail at this stage since the primary manager usually won't consent to less direct control</li><li>Growth ends with a <em>control crisis</em> where the separate parts of the organization need a more complex head office
  <ul><li>For some reason this usually happens at about 150 people</li><li>The leader and other organization heads must start establishing more clear roles for everyone</li></ul>
  </li></ul>
    <p>D. Growth through coordination and monitoring</p>
    <ul><li>Previously isolated business units are reorganized into product groups or service practices</li><li>Investing becomes centrally managed and focuses on ROI (return on investment) more than profits</li><li>Benefits include organization-wide profit-sharing arrangements aligned with organization goals</li><li>Growth ends with a <em>red-tape crisis</em> where bureaucracy halts further developments
  <ul><li>The entire organization must adapt to change</li></ul>
  </li></ul>
    <p>E. Growth through collaboration</p>
    <ul><li>Introduces a new culture and structure where professional sensibility replaces a fixed hierarchy</li><li>Teams are tasked to deliver projects and regrouped as needed instead of vast systems that rigidly define financial rewards to unchanging team structures</li><li>Growth ends with an <em>internal growth crisis</em> where the organization has reached the peak of its cultural capacity
  <ul><li>The organization can only grow further from partnerships with complementary organizations</li><li>Everyone must think beyond the scope of the organization's activities</li></ul>
  </li></ul>
    <p>F. Growth through extra-organizational answers</p>
    <ul><li>Growth continues through merger, outsourcing, networks, and other solutions with other organizations</li></ul>
    <h4>An influential organization will cross cultural boundaries</h4>
    <ul><li>The rapid information society we live in ensures large organizations become well-known very quickly</li><li>Form a vision with its global effect in mind</li><li>Developed parts of the world often forget the myriad opportunities and risks from the developing world</li></ul>
  <h3>Many cultural risks will damage an organization on every level</h3>
    <p>Avoid favoritism towards family members</p>
    <ul><li>Draft a family employee policy</li><li>Define their roles and responsibilities very clearly</li><li>Treat them like every other member of the team</li><li>Don't hire your children right out of college
  <ul><li>Let them work elsewhere in the world for a few years for them to gain much-needed experience</li></ul>
  </li></ul>
    <p>One of the most significant organizational risks is to connecting revenue to financial success</p>
    <ul><li>Revenue doesn't consider profitability, inventory management, and cash flow</li><li>Revenue also doesn't factor a product's marketability or the organization's debts</li></ul>
    <h4>Bringing together multiple unrelated groups always has risks</h4>
    <p>Uncertainty will easily cripple morale and inspire fear, so boldly negotiate and discuss</p>
    <ul><li>Don't pay too much additional for your hires (5% is fine, but 20-30% loses their value)</li></ul>
    <p>Avoid merging perceived equals</p>
    <ul><li>A merger sounds fortunate but overlooks the two group cultures</li><li>Look for irreconcilable differences in who has unspoken power in the groups</li></ul>
    <p>Make sure all the cultures complement each other</p>
    <ul><li>Combining a group from related products, technologies or numbers leads to enormous conflicts</li></ul>
    <p>Acquisitions are unequal power dynamics and adapting is more challenging</p>
    <ul><li>Don't let the concessions and clarifications from the acquired group give them all the power</li><li>On the other hand, don't disrespect the acquisition's talents or work environment</li></ul>
  <h3>Someday you'll want to retire, so make an exit plan</h3>
    <p>Consider stepping aside and retiring or going part-time</p>
    <ul><li>Don't wait to spend time with your family</li></ul>
    <p>Don't let boredom force your hand</p>
    <ul><li><a href="http://philosaccounting.com/a/success-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Find other ways to recharge yourself</a></li></ul>
    <p>Hire a replacement with the right qualifications</p>
    <ul><li>Have specific goals for your successor</li><li>Don't make the decision alone</li><li>Evaluate their personalities as thoroughly as you would with resumes</li><li>The entire organization will be uneasy, so take time to adjust your prot√©g√© into the role</li></ul>
    <p>If you're selling or leaving the company, ease everyone's fears by taking everything slowly and transparently communicating everything</p>
  Good leaders are willing to own up to their technical inability
  They listen to other people and have a team of great counsel for their decision-making
