[OLD AL] Management 1 - Starting/Assessing 10
  <h3>Professionals minimize unnecessary risk</h3>
    <p>Understands the inherent risks in their work, but tries to lower or avoid them</p>
    <li>Stays safe in their work environment</li>
    <li>Doesn't take any unnecessary risks</li>
    <li>Avoids high-risk situations whenever reasonably possible</li>
    <p>Avoids dangerous situations</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Stays safe from any excess or risk that could severely hurt their ability to perform</li>
    <li>Avoids taking on responsibilities too far from their scope of expertise by deferring to other specialists</li>
    </ul>
  <h3>Managers all share similar challenges</h3>
  Managers maintain processes, systems, and resources
  <ul>
    <li>A manager must plan and organize to direct people fulfilling roles to create results</li>
    <li>A manager uses people like resources while respecting them, which requires <a href="http://philosaccounting.com/a/coexistence-104-tact-charm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">charm and persuasion</a></span></li>
    <li>A manager, even an entrepreneur, still has a boss and must fulfill their expectations</li>
  </ul>
  High-reward or straightforward projects create certain results, but harder projects prove character and can yield tremendous gains
  <h3>Create a clear vision and strategy before assembling a team</h3>
  A manager must create results from a vision
  <ul>
    <li>Though they might adapt methods, results are often non-negotiable</li>
    <li>A manager must meet those objectives</li>
    <li>A manager's success comes from how well they can convey the vision to inspire members to create results</li>
  </ul>
  A. Specify the essential portions of the vision
  <ol>
    <li>Success requirements</li>
    <li>Type of example a leader should model</li>
    <li>Rewards for succeeding</li>
  </ol>
  B. Clarify what values you want to see
  <ul>
    <li>Values are any philosophical concept (e.g., curiosity, strength, compassion)</li>
    <li>Your chosen values determine the three R's
  <ol>
    <li>Recruit - hiring people who share those values</li>
    <li>Reward - promoting people who model those values</li>
    <li>Release - letting go of people who don't share the values</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  </ul>
  C. Examine any crucial customs or norms you want your team to show
  <ul>
    <li>Determine how you want the values to manifest</li>
  </ul>
  D. Consider the story of the group and where it came from
  <ul>
    <li>The group's experience determines where it travels next</li>
  </ul>
  E. Examine your space
  <ul>
    <li>The location and how it connects to your culture and <a href="http://philosaccounting.com/a/how-to-be-productive-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">work environment</a></span></li>
    <li>Software and equipment specific to the work</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Define how you want to build your projects</h3>
  Learn what each project needs and how the team fits into it
  <ul>
    <li>Why each project exists</li>
    <li>The "perfect ending" to the project</li>
    <li>Deadlines</li>
    <li>How often everyone will meet</li>
    <li>Size of the budget</li>
    <li>People in charge of carrying out tasks</li>
    <li>Roles and responsibilities</li>
  </ul>
  Consider each project's inputs and outputs
  <ul>
    <li>Money</li>
    <li>Hours</li>
    <li>Research</li>
    <li>Story points, outlines, ideas</li>
    <li>Sales strategies/closed Leads</li>
    <li>Ideas</li>
    <li>Treatment plans</li>
    <li>Code, articles, reports</li>
    <li>Research</li>
  </ul>
  Use Amazon's "two pizza rule" to keep teams lightweight
  <ul>
    <li>A team is too large to stay effective if two pizzas can't feed it (5-8 people)</li>
    <li>Smaller teams make communicating more straightforward</li>
    <li>Fewer people make agreeing on goals easier</li>
    <li>A team is smaller creates a stronger sense of support and camaraderie</li>
    <li>Small groups create more opportunities for change</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>You have many project management systems to adapt from</h4>
  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Waterfall</a></span> method uses a step-by-step sequence to carry a project to completion
  <ul>
    <li>Works on hard deadlines and treats every task as "final"</li>
    <li>Failures from previous process steps roll into later process tasks</li>
  </ul>
  <a href="http://agilemethodology.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Agile</a></span> works well for fast-paced projects more than Waterfall
  <ul>
    <li>The project is a general outline of the concept</li>
    <li>The system revises every development stage as the situation changes</li>
    <li>Other variations of Agile add more structure like <a href="http://scrummethodology.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scrum</a></span> or <a href="http://www.lean.org/WhatsLean/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lean</a></span></li>
  </ul>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OKR</a></span> is a simple method of tracking objectives, key results, and outcomes
  <ul>
    <li>Objectives are what the organization wants to do</li>
    <li>Key results are concrete, specific, measurable goals</li>
    <li>Outcomes track what happens over time</li>
  </ul>
  <a href="http://www.holacracy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Holacracy</a></span> is a very flat management system
  <ul>
    <li>Only use flat management if you trust everyone as a type of process manager</li>
  </ul>
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_of_responsibility" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Areas of Responsibility</a></span> defines specific immovable boundaries between responsibilities and ownership
  <h3>Plan how you want the team members to grow</h3>
  Give frequent feedback and mentorship
  <ul>
    <li>Learn focused, simple, and consistent follow-up communication</li>
  </ul>
  Provide increasing responsibilities for members
  Give members opportunities to take on leadership roles for specific responsibilities
  <ul>
    <li>Never, ever steal an idea from a subordinate</li>
  </ul>
  Invest in learning opportunities like books and conferences
  Hackman's Five Factor Model increases the chances of a team being successful
  <ul>
    <li>The group is a relational team with a shared task, clear boundaries on who the group is, and a stable membership</li>
    <li>The team has a clear and challenging goal that makes a difference</li>
    <li>The structure gives flexibility for the team to adapt to other members' changes</li>
    <li>The team appropriately rewards members, develops their skills, and provides access to relevant information</li>
    <li>The leader expertly coaches and manages the team</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Build an organization chart</h4>
  Define each person's responsibilities, strengths, weaknesses, and measurements for success (metrics)
  <h3>Create job descriptions for each role</h3>
  A summary statement
  <ul>
    <li>One or two sentences specifying duties and whom they report to</li>
  </ul>
  Functions of the position
  <ul>
    <li>Details about the job</li>
    <li>Usually the most extensive portion of a job description</li>
    <li>Describes day-to-day tasks and supervisory functions</li>
    <li>The best place to specify whom the position communicates with (customers, public or internal workers, suppliers, supervisors, departments)</li>
    <li>Physical location and work environment, if applicable</li>
  </ul>
  Necessary qualifications for the position
  <ul>
    <li>Specify machines, software, and tools</li>
    <li>Clarify any necessary or preferred education or technical background</li>
    <li>Indicate whether the job is only business or contributes to a culture</li>
  </ul>
  Reporting
  <ul>
    <li>Details about the organizational structure and reporting expectations</li>
    <li>Should help the worker understand their part in the organization</li>
  </ul>
  Evaluation criteria
  <ul>
    <li>Make measurements for success as specific as possible</li>
    <li>Define critical elements for the organization and the worker</li>
    <li>Match evaluation criteria as closely as possible to how the organization can succeed</li>
  </ul>
  Compensation
  <ul>
    <li>Specifying pay gives the candidate transparency and saves both of your time</li>
    <li>Think about their needs, not the project budget, to offer an appropriate wage
  <ul>
    <li>Many people only look at pay, especially in a competitive industry</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
    <li>Give a flexible range instead of a specific figure
  <ul>
    <li>Most people will feel their compensation should be near the top of the range</li>
    <li>Alternately, give a fixed number and pay all employees equally for their time and skill</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
    <li>Higher pay gives more opportunities for great talent
  <ul>
    <li>Pay more if the labor market becomes scarce</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
    <li>Observe the difference between contractors and employees
  <ul>
    <li>Contractors are less committed to the organization than employees</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Balance your job descriptions for your desired performance mix</h4>
  Every organization has four categories of job
  <ol>
    <li>Thinkers
  <ul>
    <li>Visionaries, strategists, intellects, and creators</li>
    <li>All significant ideas start with them
  <ul>
    <li>Creating new products</li>
    <li>Thinking of new business ideas</li>
    <li>Developing new methods</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
    <li>When hiring, look for out-of-the-box thinking about specific, tangible answers</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
    <li>Builders
  <ul>
    <li>Entrepreneurs, inventors, deal-makers, and project managers</li>
    <li>Converts Thinkers' ideas into reality
  <ul>
    <li>Building a new business</li>
    <li>Designing a new product or process</li>
    <li>Closing a deal</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
    <li>When hiring, clarify which significant changes, new developments, massive problems or significant projects they must address</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
    <li>Improvers
  <ul>
    <li>Managers of defined tasks</li>
    <li>Makes a reality or repeatable process better as individual contributors or team or project managers</li>
    <li>When hiring, look for their potential to improve the current system</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
    <li>Producers
  <ul>
    <li>Helpdesk, sales, auditing performance, writing code, producing statements</li>
    <li>Most people start as a Producer</li>
    <li>Usually requires training or advanced skills to perform correctly</li>
    <li>When hiring, determine if they can show the necessary skills for the job</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  </ol>
  Each person is a mix of all four job types with one or two dominant
  Each job requires a specific blend of the four types
  <ul>
    <li>Discover the blend through understanding the position's full requirements, other team members' strengths and weaknesses, and the group's primary objective</li>
    <li>Clarifying the job's components
  <ul>
    <li>What significant problems are unsolved? (Thinker)</li>
    <li>Do we need to carry out any substantial projects or changes? (Builder)</li>
    <li>What needs upgrading or improving? (Improver)</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
    <li>What portions of the job involve high-quality repetitious activities? (Producer)</li>
  </ul>
  <a href="http://philosaccounting.com/a/all-about-creativity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Creativity</span></a> is difficult to foster in work environments
  <ul>
    <li>While companies and non-profits branch out from Thinkers, individuals start as Producers and naturally progress through the other three types</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Organizational culture usually becomes stale over time</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>At first, Producers and Improvers do most of the work
  <ul>
    <li>TT BBB IIIIIII PPPPPPPPP</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
    <li>Improvers eventually take control when the group doesn't foster a culture of change, and risk assessment halts any further changes
  <ul>
    <li>IIIIIIIII T BB PPPPPPPPP</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
    <li>The Thinkers and Builders have found a new opportunity long before changes completely stop
  <ul>
    <li>IIIIIII PPPPPPPPP</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
    <li>Improvers eventually follow the Thinkers and builders and new Producers replace them to create order from the chaos
  <ul>
    <li>PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
    <li>Old Producers who don't change or grow must fend for themselves as the organization dwindles from a lack of new ideas
  <ul>
    <li>PPPPPP</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Build a team to carry out your vision</h3>
  <h4>Look at your current skills and gaps you need to fill</h4>
  Every potential candidate <em>could</em> fit, but effective team leaders choose wisely
  <ul>
    <li>More diverse demographics (age, gender, culture, upbringing, attitudes) typically generate more <a href="http://philosaccounting.com/a/all-about-creativity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">creative</span></a> solutions</li>
    <li>If you give the laziest person the hardest job, they'll find the easiest way to do it</li>
  </ul>
  Consider your <a href="http://philosaccounting.com/a/only-4-jobs-in-the-world-lou-adler/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">preferred leadership style</span></a>, since it will affect how the group interacts
  <ul>
    <li>Always encourage openness, autonomy, honesty, and moral character</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Decide the functions of each job role</h4>
  You must have one person fulfilling each of four possible functions
  <ol>
    <li>Acquisition - e.g., sales, marketing, business development</li>
    <li>Development - e.g., product development, engineering, service</li>
    <li>Delivery - e.g., customer support</li>
    <li>Operations - e.g., finance, HR, IT, recruiting</li>
  </ol>
  A healthy team has the broadest possible variety of members, personalities, and roles
  <ul>
    <li>Frequently include and add outside experts to the team</li>
  </ul>
  Use Belbin's nine roles to assess the types of people you want
  <ul>
    <li>Shapers challenge the team to improve</li>
    <li>Implementers get things done</li>
    <li>Completer-Finishers ensure finalized and completed projects</li>
    <li>Coordinators take a traditional team leader role</li>
    <li>Team Workers negotiate to ensure everyone works together</li>
    <li>Resource Investigators work with external stakeholders to help the team's objectives</li>
    <li>Plants create new ideas and approaches</li>
    <li>Monitor-Evaluators analyze and observe others' ideas</li>
    <li>Specialists possess trade-specific knowledge</li>
  </ul>
  Each member will fit into one of eight Margerison-McCann team profiles
  <ul>
    <li>Reporter/Advisor gathers information and helps others understand it</li>
    <li>Creator/Innovator looks for alternate perspectives</li>
    <li>Explorer/Promoter persuasively influences others easily</li>
    <li>Assessor/Developer evaluates and analyzes</li>
    <li>Thruster/Organizer focuses solely on results</li>
    <li>Concluder/Producer completes activities according to a scheduled plan</li>
    <li>Controller/Inspector manages details and enforces standards</li>
    <li>Upholder/Maintainer holds the team together by tending to emotional and social needs</li>
  </ul>
  If your situation permits, consider remote teams
  <ul>
    <li>Telecommuting typically cuts costs and expands your potential members to the entire world</li>
    <li>Teams using freelancing and remote work with no in-person interaction has become conventional in many industries</li>
  </ul>
