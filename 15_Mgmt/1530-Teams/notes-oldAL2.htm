[OLD AL] Management 1 - Assembling 14
  <h3>Search for candidates correctly</h3>
  Everyone promises they can do the job, but you need specific skills more than likability or general aptitude
  <h4>Look for the BEST personality for your role</h4>
  Personality determines fit from preferences, not aptitude
  <ul>
    <li>Mentally well people take on roles of their less dominant styles as they mature</li>
    <li>Mentally unhealthy people intensify their adverse behaviors over time</li>
    <li>Take on the diametrically opposite role during the interview to see the candidate more objectively</li>
  </ul>
  A. Each person focuses more on tasks or other people
  B. Each person prefers to make their decisions slowly or quickly
  Boss (task-focused, quick decisions)
  <ul>
    <li>Dominant, driven, and confident</li>
    <li>Risks behaving insensitively to others</li>
  </ul>
  Engager (people-focused, quick decisions)
  <ul>
    <li>Persuasive, convincing, and closes deals</li>
    <li>However, can put pressure on others</li>
  </ul>
  Supporter (people-focused, slow decisions)
  <ul>
    <li>Collaborative, understanding, and counsels others</li>
    <li>Can be bureaucratic and slow</li>
  </ul>
  Technical (task-focused, slow decisions)
  <ul>
    <li>Analytical, insightful, and deliberative</li>
    <li>Can be overcontrolling</li>
  </ul>
  Avoid building a homogenous mix of personalities in your team
  <ul>
    <li>Teams with only planners talk much and do little</li>
    <li>Teams with only performers take many unnecessary risks</li>
    <li>Task-based teams invalidate the human element in the team and outside the group</li>
    <li>People-based teams become a progressively more disorganized and unproductive mess</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Conventional interviewing techniques are flawed</h4>
  The interview is both seen as standard practice and the fastest way to gauge performance
  <ul>
    <li>However, a 30-minute interview doesn't measure much</li>
    <li>A conventional interview only assesses a candidate's ability to convince others</li>
    <li>Technical interviews focus on a given task without looking at cultural fit</li>
  </ul>
  An interview can undercut relevant information
  <ul>
    <li>In college recruiting, interviewers skew against students with lower GPA's who may have more qualifications</li>
    <li>A candidate's lies are almost always impossible to discern since <a href="http://philosaccounting.com/a/dissecting-pinocchio-christopher-dillingham-m-a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">there's no social context to pull from</span></a></li>
  </ul>
  Create alternative ways to interview well
  <ul>
    <li>Only ask practical questions
  <ul>
    <li>Discover more about them by asking them what they've been recently reading</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
    <li>Give them homework and interview them based on their performance
  <ul>
    <li>The homework could be an unimportant task for the organization</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
    <li>Instead of giving an interview, have them interview you instead to gauge their ability to think</li>
    <li>Give internships or 30-day no-obligation trial periods to find viable technical workers</li>
    <li>Finding competent workers on the job market is often more difficult than grooming interns into great workers</li>
    <li>If you can afford it, give a skills test battery with a 30-day trial period</li>
    <li>Interviewing well is a skill of trial-and-error</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Look for the correct traits in a candidate</h4>
  A candidate is a good hire if you see several universal traits
  <ul>
    <li>Adaptable to spontaneous or unplanned situations without losing their nerve</li>
    <li>Open to new ideas and experiences</li>
    <li>Honest about their skills, limitations, and capabilities
  <ul>
    <li>Don't hire them if they distrust you in the interview or are somehow withholding</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
    <li>Resourceful and steadily improving in long-term learning outside formal education</li>
    <li>Self-disciplined and desires to create work others will use</li>
    <li>Desires to grow with clear career goals unrelated to titles or status
  <ul>
    <li>A career goal for a title or the ability to direct others is a negative trait</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
    <li>Rationally and openly admits graciously when they're wrong, even when only slightly</li>
    <li>Team-oriented and focused on the organization's collective growth
  <ul>
    <li>Watch if they brag about proudly defending something or gaining ground</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
    <li>Since you're hiring them for competence in something you may not know, they should be smarter than you</li>
  </ul>
  Some circumstances need specific traits, so ignore capability and look for fit on the following
  <ul>
    <li>Being sociable is risky in an environment with little human connection</li>
    <li>Analytical tendencies are risky when you want enthusiasm and energy</li>
    <li>Ambitiousness can harm a complex process-oriented system</li>
    <li>Team players often hate working alone</li>
    <li>Perfectionists are often dangerous when results demand speed or adaptation</li>
    <li>Young people are more ambitious and reckless, while older people are more skilled and jaded</li>
  </ul>
  Reject a candidate, no matter what, for any job position on the following
  <ul>
    <li>Unintelligent or entirely unwilling to learn new things</li>
    <li>A depressing or miserable personality</li>
    <li>Tends to use hyperbole, extremism or overly emotional reactions</li>
    <li>So overconfident in their abilities they can't accept mistakes</li>
    <li>A poor personality mix for the position</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Start looking for workers before you need them</h4>
  It always takes longer to find good workers than it seems
  <ul>
    <li>Recruit or think of new ways to recruit every single day</li>
    <li>You may not think you need them now, but great talent ready to work is an insurance policy</li>
    <li>Consulting a list of great options is better than feeling pressured to make a quick decision</li>
  </ul>
  Use appropriate social media networks and software
  <ul>
    <li>If you find an applicant you love, gain their trust by impressing their family</li>
    <li>Weed out poor fits for the position with applicant-tracking software</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Advertise correctly</h3>
  A worker will only transfer if they feel they're receiving at least a 30% non-monetary increase
  <ul>
    <li>Their change includes new skills learned, job growth, and a better mix of more satisfying work</li>
    <li>The less someone feels others appreciate their work, the more you'll need to pay</li>
  </ul>
  Make the job advertisement interesting, exciting, and in the first-person
  <ul>
    <li>A job advertisement which sounds boring deters talented workers</li>
    <li>Attract more talent with witty and entertaining <a href="http://philosaccounting.com/a/writing-basics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writing</a></span></li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Avoid a tedious or robotic applicant tracking system</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Your hiring process should honor the qualifications and time of experts</li>
    <li>Don't penalize blank spaces or require too many text boxes for them to enter information</li>
  </ul>
  Stay in fluid and natural communication with all applicants
  <ul>
    <li>Robotic communication implies a robotic company policy</li>
    <li>Give every applicant an interview rejection or approval if the application has a deadline</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Value their time and yours in interviews</h3>
  Use software like <a href="http://interviewstream.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">InterviewStream</span></a> for long-distance communication
  Avoid conventional phrases which don't make sense
  <ul>
    <li>"We're the best at what we do" - vague and sets an impossible expectation</li>
    <li>"We are experts" - implies everyone in the organization is an expert</li>
    <li>"We've been doing this for X years" - implies an unchanging culture</li>
    <li>"We have a tough interview process" - not necessarily true for <a href="http://philosaccounting.com/a/get-a-job/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">talented interviewers</a></span></li>
    <li>"We don't post jobs; we run off of recommendations" - implies an inbred culture of friend-coworkers</li>
  </ul>
  Asking a patronizing, irrelevant or stupid question will usually lead a true <a href="http://philosaccounting.com/a/level-1-being-a-professional/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">professional</span></a> to believe their time is worth more than yours
  <h4>Try to discern between a great interviewer and a great candidate</h4>
  Gut instincts are great for business decisions but awful for choosing candidates
  <ul>
    <li>If you doubt whether someone can do the task, look for specific reasons you have your doubts</li>
    <li>Even if you're rushing to fill a position, never emphasize skills and experience more than performance, attitude, and fit</li>
  </ul>
  Ask direct and pointed questions instead of vague or general ones
  Use a sales pitch for the position, then watch their reaction to understand how they'd fit into the culture
  Have multiple members of the team meet or interview the candidate
  <ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:none;"></li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Pick the right questions for what you want to learn</h4>
  Don't ask questions which don't reflect their ability to do the job
  <ul>
    <li>The presence of any notable employers, impressive educational credentials, GPAs or any external commendations</li>
    <li>Scores on personality tests, at least outside the job description's needs
  <ul>
    <li>If you're interviewing correctly, you should have weeded them out from the interview already</li>
    <li>However, personality results can help determine if they're lying or self-unaware</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
    <li>Past or present salary, which only measures their ability to negotiate</li>
    <li>Age, family or any other demographics</li>
    <li>Gaps in employment, though you should know why they left their last job</li>
    <li>Tasks and duties from past jobs don't matter, only whether they can perform the current one
  <ul>
    <li>"Progressively more responsible positions" don't matter either</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
  "What is your greatest accomplishment?"
  <ul>
    <li>The best question you can ask
  <ul>
    <li>Shows what they value most</li>

    <li>Ask for details
  <ul>
    <li>When did it happen and how long did it take?</li>
    <li>What results did you achieve?</li>
    <li>What was the organization, role, title, position, and team?</li>
    <li>What parts of the project did you enjoy or dislike?</li>
    <li>How did this accomplishment change and grow you?</li>
    <li>What types of formal recognition did you receive from it?</li>
    <li>If you could do it again, what would you do differently?</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>

    <li>Shows their problem-solving ability</li>
    <li>Shows their preference for details and specificity</li>
    <li>Make your own to have more fun or find specific problem-solving skills</li>
  </ul>
  "Tell me about yourself."
  <ul>
    <li>A common question every job candidate should be ready to answer</li>
    <li>Shows how well they think through their experiences</li>
  </ul>
  "What can you do to bring our organization to the next level?"
  <ul>
    <li>Gives you potentially great ideas and whether the candidate has a vision for the future</li>
  </ul>
  "Describe a situation where you had to manage multiple things in your personal or work life. How did you deal with it?"
  <ul>
    <li>Shows their ability to handle stress and intense work environments</li>
  </ul>
  "What have you done to improve yourself in the last two years?"
  <ul>

  </ul>
  <h4>Many candidates use the same lies</h4>
  Education lies
  <ul>
    <li>"I have all the credits; I just didn't graduate."</li>
    <li>"I've done all the classes; I just need to pay the fees to graduate."</li>
    <li>"I graduated from (university), but it was a long time ago. I'm not sure why they can't verify my degree."</li>
