310 MANAGEMENT

Producers are proportional instruments, but managers are exponential instruments
Negativity is a cancer. Never hire negative people and fire them asap
You need respect and loyalty
Team planning
  • Asana, iDoneThis or Slack - track a team project
  • Plan - schedule your tasks into a calendar
  • WhichDateWorks.com - synchronize a date for a social event
  • Doodle - schedule appointments using "polls" to ensure everyone meets
  • Assistant.to - meeting scheduling
  • WorkLife - focuses meetings on what matters
Try to avoid all unnecessary meetings
Most meetings can be summarized by an email
  • Be clear about the specified end time, which should never be more than 30 minutes unless it's critical

  • Cost - how affordable the item is
  • Time - how fast the customer can receive the product
  • Quality - how reliable, effective, and great the product is
  • High-quality of all three is impossible, so professionals have to choose two they prefer to provide
A team forms through several stages
A. Forming - relationships established in the group, goals are clarified, the manager defines the team's goals and tasks
  • Marked by avoiding conflict and relationships formed
  • Avoiding conflict yields very little work accomplished
  • Its length depends on how clear tasks are defined and everyone's experience in the team
  • Autonomous people, complicated tasks, or a variety of tasks will slow down the Forming stage
  • The manager is very "hands-on" in this stage
B. Storming - team members feel capable of expressing and questioning opinions
  • More evidence of internal conflict
  • The manager will try to direct nervous energy into something productive
  • Morale will dip when strongly expressed views and differences between expectations and reality appear
  • Storming will resolve relatively quickly without any guidance or support and is necessary for the team to work together
  • Team members will try to console and encourage everyone involved
  • A manager who tries to force through this stage can permanently splinter the group
C. Norming - team focuses on resolving differences to define the mission and goals
  • Marked by trust, mutual respect, cohesion, and harmony
  • Team members learn more about each other and how they work together
  • The team sets core standards about conduct, values, and measuring performance
  • The manager is now a team member with everyone else
  • The team starts developing a sense of team pride and productivity increases from it
D. Performing - genuine benefits to the organization
  • Marked by high levels of loyalty, cohesiveness, shared work as an autonomous unit, and confident decisions
  • The team completes work at each stage, but Performing is the most productive
  • The manager is now an overseer who delegates tasks
  • Team members feel confident and eager to be part of the team
  • Everyone is optimistic about the outcome, openly communicates, and is highly energetic
  • Everyone expects disagreement and encourages it as long as members channel it through a meaningful process the team agrees on
Great team players change their lifestyle to avoid dysfunctional teams
The most dangerous team dysfunction is in "teams" by name only
  • Managers setting goals as opposed to teams setting personal goals to benefit the group
  • Team members responsible for only their tasks instead of the team sharing the burden
  • Manager assigns tasks to individual members instead of the team as a whole unit
  • Most feedback and discussions are solely between the manager and a team member instead of between the members
Team dysfunction often derives from group-think
  Group-think is the tendency to not think individually and personally on apparent issues and challenges which face the group
    1. Members misjudge their standards as higher than reality and that they can't fail
    2. They rationalize everything to discredit legitimate warnings or negative feedback
    3. Everyone pressures each other to stay quiet about any complaints or negative consequences
  Group-think creates many negative results
    • Higher peer pressure against positive changes
    • State of complacency about group tasks
    • Highly censored opinions everyone publicly conforms to
    • Illusions about unanimous agreement on a decision
Team dysfunction decays through five stages
A. Absence of trust
  • Unwilling to admit mistakes, weaknesses or the need for help
  • Comes from a refusal to expose any vulnerability to one another
B. Fear of conflict
  • Fear of engaging in unfiltered and passionate debate over critical issues
  • Comes from strong distrust and causes team conflicts through veiled discussions and implicating comments
C. Lack of commitment
  • Unwilling to agree to anything without a conflict
  • Creates significant ambiguity which disgruntles employees, especially the best employees
D. Avoiding accountability
  • Nobody is held responsible
  • Unfulfilled promises create an unclear plan of action
  • Everyone becomes hesitant to call out counterproductive behaviors
E. No more focus on results
  • The group no longer sees a need to achieve
  • Without accountability, members will naturally place personal interests over the team's needs
  • Since the group no longer desires success, it inevitably fails

  Give people WHAT to do, then expand MORE information as they request or is needed
  Don't overload them with arbitrary info, people get overwhelmed or start managing themselves instead of trusting your guidance!
