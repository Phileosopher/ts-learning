[OLD AL] Business 2 A Business Plan 16
  always consider the customers' desires
    <ul><li>Customers pay the entire organization</li>
    <li>Consistency is often more valuable than quality</li>
    <li>Customers care about fast and reliable results more than distributors, vendors, sellers or anyone else</li>
    <li>Customers choose an expert because they appear to be more valuable than the competition</li></ul>
    <li>Results-driven performance means sometimes saying "yes" to work outside the job description or saying "no" to something far outside the scope of the work</li></ul>
  If you do get investors, bear in mind that THEY'RE taking a risk on you
    This means that since you believe in your product more than them, their risk tolerance will be lower and worth considering in your business decisions
  The business plan should come AFTER you have a legitimate dream in mind
    The business plan is the easy part: it's just unpacking what already exists that you built in your mind
  Figure out your profit moment
    This is when you will make a profit instead of a loss for that month
    Find out how much time until the money runs out to see how much "fudge room" you have
    You want to get to this point as fast as possible, or you have ZERO security that your business will stay open
    While you may think you can raise money later after the first round, it won't go that easily later because the investors will have lost [faith] in you
      What bites them the second time is a confluence of three forces:
        The company is spending more now than it did the first time it raised money.
        Investors have much higher standards for companies that have already raised money.
        The company is now starting to read as a failure. The first time it raised money, it was neither a success nor a failure; it was too early to ask. Now it's possible to ask that question, and the default answer is failure, because at this point that is the default outcome. 
  If you can start small, do it
    Because of technology, startups in many industries are extremely affordable to begin, sometimes only the cost of food and rent!
  The offering MUST add value to EVERY stakeholder: customers, vendors/collaborators, the company's employees
    Otherwise, you can't [market] it reliably
