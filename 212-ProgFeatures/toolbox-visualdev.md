## Realworld

The first repository in this list is [Realworld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld). Its creators call it nothing less than ‚ÄúThe Mother of all Demo Apps.‚Äù A bold statement, for sure, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs an exaggeration.
Realworld is an exemplary Medium.com clone. But not only that. The repository lets you choose between different front end and back end implementations, which you can happily mix.  
Vue.js + Node/Express or React /Redux + Rust? They got it!
Realworld shows you how the exact same blog app is built on almost any popular language or framework. How awesome is that?

The best thing? It‚Äôs completely free to read! It‚Äôs definitely one of the best series about JavaScript and it really helped me to understand what JS is really about. Even if you think you know JavaScript well ‚Äî read the books! You will be surprised, I promise.
