Computers are now fast enough that there's leftover processing power
  Some engineers were smart enough to create virtualization
  Virtualization basically makes "boxes" inside the main computer, by separating off the different parts of the computer (RAM, memory, etc)
Virtualization manages "endpoints", which is basically the different "instances" of the multiple environments it reproduces
This scales into a HUGE array of services
  VMware, for example, has vSphere and vSAN that allows you to pretty much manage ALL the computers as if they were 1 computer
Vmware cert
  VCA-DBT - $150
  Gain experience in one of the following:
    Data Center Virtualization (DCV) - vSphere
    Network Virtualization (NV) - vSphere and NSX
    Cloud Management and Automation (CMA) - vSphere and vRealize
    Desktop and Mobility (DTM) - vSphere and vHorizon
    Digital Workspace (DW) - WorkspaceOne and Digital Workspace Solutions
  Train for 1st VCP - VMware vSphere: Install, configure, manage
    Except DW - WorkspaceOne: deploy and manage
  vSphere foundations exam
  Elective course optional to get VCP ($250 for test) -
    DCV - VMware vSphere: optimize and scale
