  Claasen's law, or the logarithmic law of usefulness: usefulness = log(technology).
  Cramer's rule: In linear algebra, an explicit formula for the solution of a system of linear equations with as many equations as unknowns, valid whenever the system has a unique solution. Named after Swiss mathematician Gabriel Cramer.
  Cromwell's rule states that the use of prior probabilities of 0 ("the event will definitely not occur") or 1 ("the event will definitely occur") should be avoided, except when applied to statements that are logically true or false, such as 2+2 equaling 4 or 5.
  Frege's principle: The meaning of a complex expression is determined by the meanings of its constituent expressions and the rules used to combine them.
  Haber's rule is a mathematical statement relating the concentration of a poisonous gas and how long it must be breathed to result in death.
  LaSalle's invariance principle is a criterion for the asymptotic stability of an autonomous (possibly nonlinear) dynamical system. Named for mathematician Joseph P. LaSalle.
  VopÄ›nka's principle, in mathematics, is a large cardinal axiom that states that the set-theoretical universe is so large that in every proper class, some members are similar to others, with this similarity formalized through elementary embeddings. Named after Petr VopÄ›nka.
  Weyl law, in mathematics, describes the asymptotic behavior of eigenvalues of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. Named for Hermann Weyl.

  <ul><li><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27H%C3%B4pital%27s_rule" title="L'Hôpital's rule">L'Hôpital's rule</a> uses derivatives to find limits of indeterminate forms 0/0 or ±∞/∞, and only applies to such cases.</li>
  Grosch's law: the economic value of computation increases with the square root of the increase in speed; that is, to do a calculation 10 times as cheaply you must do it 100 times as fast. Stated by Herb Grosch in 1965.
  Hamilton's principle: the dynamics of a physical system is determined by a variational problem for a functional based on a single function, the Lagrangian, which contains all physical information concerning the system and the forces acting on it. Named after William Rowan Hamilton.
  Hasse principle is the idea that one can find an integer solution to an equation by using the Chinese remainder theorem to piece together solutions modulo powers of each different prime number. Named after Helmut Hasse.
  Stevens's power law, in psychophysics, relates the intensity of a stimulus to its perceived strength. It supersedes the Weber-Fechner law, since it can describe a wider range of sensations. The theory is named after its inventor, S. Smith Stevens (1906â€“1973).
  Lanchester's laws are formulae for calculating the relative strengths of predator/prey pair and application in military conflict.
  Little's law, in queuing theory: "The average number of customers in a stable system (over some time interval) is equal to their average arrival rate, multiplied by their average time in the system." The law was named for John Little from results of experiments in 1961.
  Malthusian growth model, also referred to as the Malthusian law or simple exponential growth model, is exponential growth based on a constant rate. The model is named after Thomas Robert Malthus, who wrote An Essay on the Principle of Population (1798), one of the earliest and most influential books on population.
  Ricco's law: In human vision, the product of contrast and area is a constant for small targets below the resolution limit.
  Spearman's Hypothesis : The magnitudes of the black-white differences on tests of cognitive ability positively correlate with the tests' g-loading.
