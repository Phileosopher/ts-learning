Statistical mechanics – probabalistic systems that follow certain laws in the long run can have perturbations that diverge from these laws in the short run.

  Corollary: Occasionally the status quo can be easily improved without significant resources (but it is unlikely that you found such an occassion).
  Idiom: In the short run the market is a voting machine, but in the long run it is a weighing machine.
  Idiom: If an economist saw a $100 bill on a sidewalk they wouldn’t pick it up (because if it were real, it would have been picked up already).
Base rates – you can approximate the likelihood of a specific event occurring by examining the wider probability distribution of similar events.
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_rate
  Example: You’re evaluating the probability of success of a given startup. Ask yourself, if you saw ten similar startups a year, how many of them are likely to succeed?
  Example: You caught an employee stealing, but they claim they need money to buy medication and it’s the first time they’ve ever stolen anything. Ask yourself, if you saw ten employee thefts a year, how many of them are likely to be first offences?
  Note: This method is especially useful to combat optimism and overconfidence biases, or when evaluating outcomes of events you’re emotionally close to.

Expected value – a simple model for evaluating uncertain events (multiply the probability of the event by its value).
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value
  Corollary: Sometimes you’ll have to estimate probabilities when it feels really hard to do.
  Example: Chance of winning NY lotto is 1 in 292,201,338 per game. Let’s say the grand prize is $150M and ticket price is $1. Then the expected value is roughly $0.5. Since $0.5 < $1, the model tells us the game isn’t worth playing.
  Warning: Looking at expected value often isn’t enough. You need to consider utility to make good decisions.
