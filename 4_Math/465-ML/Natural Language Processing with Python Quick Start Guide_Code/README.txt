I recommend having a computer nearby while reading this book so that you can explore
the user interface options in GitLab as you go. While knowledge of PHP isn't a prerequisite,
it is used in the example project, so passing familiarity is handy. If you've used other objectoriented programming languages before it'll mostly make sense.
